Check-Script: deb-format
Author: Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>
Abbrev: dfmt
Type: binary, udeb
Needs-Info: unpacked, changelog-file, bin-pkg-control, index
Info: This script checks the format of the deb ar archive itself.

Tag: malformed-deb-archive
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The binary package is not a correctly constructed archive.  A binary
 Debian package must be an ar archive with exactly three members:
 <tt>debian-binary</tt>, <tt>control.tar.gz</tt>, and one of
 <tt>data.tar.gz</tt>, <tt>data.tar.bz2</tt> or <tt>data.tar.xz</tt>
 in exactly that order.  The <tt>debian-binary</tt> member must start
 with a single line containing the version number, with a major revision
 of 2.
Ref: deb(5)

Tag: lzma-deb-archive
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The data portion of this binary package is compressed with lzma.
 This is supported by dpkg but not yet permitted in the Debian archive.
 Such a package will be rejected by DAK.

Tag: tar-errors-from-control
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: tar produced an error while listing the contents of the
 <tt>control.tar.gz</tt> member of this package.  This probably means
 there's something broken or at least strange about the way the package
 was constructed.

Tag: tar-errors-from-data
Severity: important
Certainty: possible
Info: tar produced an error while listing the contents of the data
 member of this package.  This probably means there's something broken or
 at least strange about the way the package was constructed.

Tag: udeb-uses-unsupported-compression-for-data-tarball
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Info: The data tarball of this udeb package is not compressed in format
 that udpkg (debian-installer's dpkg equivalent) does not support.  Thus
 the udeb is likely to be uninstallable and could break daily or weekly
 d-i images.
 .
 Currently, udpkg supports .gz and .xz compressed tarballs.

Tag: data.tar.xz-member-without-dpkg-pre-depends
Severity: pedantic
Certainty: certain
Info: The deb uses xz compression for the data member, which requires
 a Pre-Depends on dpkg (&gt;= 1.15.6~).  This is trivially satisfied in
 Debian, but it can complicate upgrades from Ubuntu Lucid where dpkg
 1.15.6 is not currently available.
