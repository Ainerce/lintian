Tag: not-binnmuable-any-depends-any
Type: error
Info: The package is not safely binNMUable because an arch:any package
 depends on another arch:any package with a (= ${source:Version})
 relationship. Please use (= ${binary:Version}) instead.

Tag: not-binnmuable-any-depends-all
Type: warning
Info: The package is not safely binNMUable because an arch:any package
 depends on an arch:all package with a (= ${Source-Version}) or
 (= ${binary:Version}) relationship. Please use (= ${source:Version})
 instead.

Tag: not-binnmuable-all-depends-any
Type: warning
Info: The package is not safely binNMUable because an arch:all package
 depends on an arch:any package with a strict (= ${Source-Version}), or
 similar, relationship.
 .
 It is not possible for arch:all packages to depend so strictly on
 arch:any packages while having the package binNMUable, so please use
 one of these, whichever is more appropriate:
 .
   Depends: arch_any (>= ${source:Version})
   Depends: arch_any (>= ${source:Version}), arch_any (<< ${source:Version}.1~)

Tag: version-substvar-for-external-package
Type: error
Info: The first package has a dependency on the second package that uses
 (= ${binary:Version}), (= ${source:Version}), or (= ${Source-Version}),
 but the second package is not built from this source package.  Usually
 this means there is a mistake in the package name in this dependency.
