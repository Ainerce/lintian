Tag: missing-debian-source-format
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: With the introduction of new source formats, it's now recommended to
 explicitly select the desired source format in debian/source/format.
 .
 If you don't have a good reason to stick with the old format,
 you should switch to "3.0 (quilt)" (for packages with a separate
 upstream tarball) or to "3.0 (native)" (for Debian native packages).
 .
 If you plan to keep using the old format, you should still create
 that file and put "1.0" in it. In that case, you are invited to get in
 touch with debian-dpkg@lists.debian.org to discuss the (technical) reasons
 why the new formats do not suit you.
