# /etc/lintianrc -- Lintian configuration file
#
# Note, that Lintian has reasonable default values for all variables
# specified below. Thus, you don't have to change this file unless you
# want something special.
# 
# Also note, that this file uses a special syntax:
# Empty lines are allowed, comments are introduced by a hash sign (#).
# All other lines must have the format
#    VAR=text
# or
#    VAR="text"
# It is allowed to use `~' and `$HOME' in the variables, but not other
# shell/environment variables.

# Specify a laboratory--a directory where Lintian should store some info
# about packages being checked.
#LINTIAN_LAB="/var/spool/lintian"

# Override default unpack level. By setting this to 0, Lintian will
# automatically remove any unpacked packages after they have been
# processed.
#LINTIAN_UNPACK_LEVEL="0"

# If you want lintian to check the whole Debian archive instead of just
# single packages you have to set the LINTIAN_DIST variable to the root
# directory of the distribution archive (i.e., a local Debian mirror).
#
#LINTIAN_DIST="/ftp/debian/dists/unstable"

# Specify a default architecture--when checking the full archive (as
# specified by LINTIAN_DIST), Lintian will only check packages of this
# architecture or of architecture `all'.
#LINTIAN_ARCH="i386"
