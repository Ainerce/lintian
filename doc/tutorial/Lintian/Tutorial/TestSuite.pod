=head1 NAME

Lintian::Tutorial::TestSuite -- Quick intro to running the Lintian testsuite

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This guide will quickly introduce you to running the Lintian test
suite and some tricks.  The Lintian test suite is fairly large and
accordingly it can take a substantial amount of time to run.  To speed
up development, there are various options to limit the tests to run.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Lintian test suite is an extensive collection of various test
cases.  The test suite is divided into 5 "sub-suites".  The majority
of all tests are currently located in the "tests" sub-suite.

To run the full suite in all of its glory, simply invoke:

 $ debian/rules runtests

But while writing a new tag (or check) you probably only want to run a
particular (subset of the) test(s).  See L</Running a subset of the
tests> for the available options.

The test suite respects the "DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=n", though "n"
denotes the amount of "worker" threads.  The test runner will
generally have 2 threads more than that.  Also each "worker" will run
lintian, which runs multiple unpacking jobs in parallel as well.

In case you are wondering about the 2 extra threads in the test
runner, the first of them is the "coordinator"-thread (which will
generally be waiting when the workers are active) and the second one
is the "output"-thread (which handles the fancy output).

=head2 Running a subset of the tests

The following options are available:

=over 4

=item Running a single test

To run a single test by its name, use:

 $ debian/rules runtests onlyrun=$name

=item Running all tests for a check

To run all tests for a given check, use:

 $ debian/rules runtests onlyrun=$check

$check must be the name of a check (it will test for
checks/$check.desc) or "legacy".  This will run all tests that starts
with "$check-".

Note: The "changes" sub-suite in the new test suite does not support
this.

=item Running all tests in a sub-suite

To run all tests in a given sub-suite, use:

 $ debian/rules runtests onlyrun=suite:$suites

$suites is a comma-separated list of names of sub-suites to run.

Note: this cannot be used to influence the order, in which the sub-suites
are run.

=item Running all tests designed for a specific tag

To run all tests that has a "Test-For" or a "Test-Against" for a given
tag, use:

 $ debian/rules runtests onlyrun=tag:$tag

Alternatively:

 $ debian/rules check-tag tag=$tag
