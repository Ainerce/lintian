IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT THE USE OF LINTIAN:

  1. Lintian is not finished yet and will probably never be. Please don't
    use Lintian as a reference for Debian policy. Lintian might miss a lot
    of policy violations while it might also report some violations by
    mistake. If in doubt, please check out the policy manuals.

  2. The Debian policy gives the maintainers a lot of freedom. In most
    cases, the guidelines included in the manuals allow exceptions. Thus,
    if Lintian reports a policy violation on a package and you think this
    is such an exception (or if you think Lintian has a bug itself) please
    contact the authors of Lintian about this. There is an `override'
    file which tells Lintian about policy exceptions.

  3. Please DO NOT use Lintian to file bug reports (neither single ones nor
    mass bug reports). This is done by authors of Lintian already and
    duplication of efforts and bug reports should be avoided! If you think
    a certain bug is `critical', and should be reported/fixed immediately,
    please contact the maintainer of the corresponding package and/or the
    Lintian maintainers.

  4. Any feedback about Lintian is welcome! Please send your comments to
    <lintian-maint@debian.org>.
