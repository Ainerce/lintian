W: scripts source: ancient-standards-version 3.2.1
N:
N:   The source package refers to a `Standards-Version' older than one
N:   year. Please update your package to latest policy and set this control
N:   field appropriately.
N:   
N:   If the package is already compliant with the current standards, you
N:   don't have to re-upload the package just to adjust the
N:   Standards-Version control field. However, please remember to update
N:   this field next time you upload the package.

E: scripts: binary-without-manpage perlfoo
N:
N:   Each binary in /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /bin, /sbin, or /usr/games, must
N:   have a manual page.
N:   
N:   Note, that though the `man' program has the capability to check for
N:   several program names in the NAMES section, each of these programs
N:   must have its own manual page (a symbolic link to the appropriate
N:   manual page is sufficient) because other manual page viewers such as
N:   xman or tkman don't support this.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.1 for details.

E: scripts: binary-without-manpage py2foo
E: scripts: binary-without-manpage pyfoo
E: scripts: python-script-but-no-python-dep ./usr/bin/pyfoo
N:
N:   Packages with scripts that are executed with python must depend on the
N:   package python. Those that have scripts executed with a versioned
N:   python package need a dependency on the equivalent version of python.
N:   
N:   For example, if a script in the package uses #!/usr/bin/python, then
N:   the package needs a dependency on "python". If a script uses
N:   #!/usr/bin/python2.2, then the package need a dependency on
N:   "python2.2".
N:   
N:   In some cases a weaker relationship, such as Suggests or Recommends,
N:   will be more appropriate.
N:
E: scripts: python-script-but-no-python-dep ./usr/bin/py2foo
E: scripts: no-copyright-file
N:
N:   Each binary package has to include a plain file
