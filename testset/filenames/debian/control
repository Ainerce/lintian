Description: see how lintian reacts to weird filenames
 This package contains files with the most evil names I could find,
 except for ones that lintian is explicitly not designed to handle.
 .
 Lintian does not handle filenames containing newlines, or filenames
 that contain the strings " link to ", " -> ", or ": ".  The last one
 is used as a separator by the file command, the others are used as
 separators by tar.
 .
 Lintian also does not handle filenames that contain backslashes, or
 other characters that are mangled by tar's -tv output.
