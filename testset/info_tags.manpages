W: manpages source: ancient-standards-version 3.2.1
N:
N:   The source package refers to a `Standards-Version' older than one
N:   year. Please update your package to latest policy and set this control
N:   field appropriately.
N:   
N:   If the package is already compliant with the current standards, you
N:   don't have to re-upload the package just to adjust the
N:   Standards-Version control field. However, please remember to update
N:   this field next time you upload the package.

E: manpages: manpage-not-compressed usr/share/man/man1/usr-bin-binary.1
N:
N:   Manual pages have to be installed compressed (using `gzip -9').
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.1 for details.
N:
E: manpages: empty-manual-page usr/share/man/man1/usr-bin-binary.1
N:
N:   The referenced manual page is empty.
N:
E: manpages: manpage-has-bad-whatis-entry usr/share/man/man1/usr-bin-binary.1
N:
N:   Each manual page should start with a `NAME' section, which lists the
N:   name and a brief description of the page. These sections are parsed by
N:   `mandb' and stored in a database for the use of `apropos' and
N:   `whatis', so they must be in a certain format. This manual page
N:   apparently uses the wrong format and cannot be parsed by `mandb'.
N:   
N:   For information on how `NAME' sections should be written and a list of
N:   some common mistakes, please see the lexgrog(8) manual page.

E: manpages: manpage-has-wrong-extension usr/X11R6/man/man6/X11R6-binary.man
N:
N:   The manual page has an extension other than `<section>[<program>].gz'.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 13.1 for details.
N:
W: manpages: x11-games-should-be-in-usr-games usr/X11R6/man/man6/X11R6-binary.man
N:
N:   Since X11 games should be installed in /usr/games (and not in
N:   /usr/X11R6/bin) and the game's manual pages should be installed in
N:   /usr/share/man/man6, the directory /usr/X11R6/man/man6 should be
N:   (nearly) empty.
N:   
N:   There are a few exceptions though, as utilities like `xeyes'. If this
N:   is one of these exceptions, please contact lintian-maint@debian.org
N:   about this so that this exception would be recognized in future
N:   versions of Lintian.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 11.11 for details.

W: manpages: link-to-undocumented-manpage usr/share/man/man1/bin-binary.1.gz
N:
N:   Symbolic links to the undocumented(7) manual page may be provided if
N:   no manual page is available, but that is deprecated.
N:   
N:   The lack of a manual page is still a bug, and if at all possible you
N:   should write one yourself.
N:   
N:   For help with writing manual pages, refer to the Man-Page-HOWTO at
N:   http://www.schweikhardt.net/man_page_howto.html, the examples created
N:   by debmake or dh_make, or the /usr/share/doc/man-db/examples
N:   directory. If the package provides --help output, you might want to
N:   use the help2man utility to generate a simple manual page.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.1 for details.
N:
E: manpages: bad-link-to-undocumented-manpage usr/share/man/man1/sbin-binary.1.gz
N:
N:   The symbolic link should reference `../man[237]/undocumented.[237].gz'
N:   for manual pages in /usr/share/man or
N:   `../../../share/man/man[237]/undocumented.[237].gz' for manual pages
