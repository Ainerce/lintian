W: binary source: ancient-standards-version 3.2.1
N:
N:   The source package refers to a `Standards-Version' older than one
N:   year. Please update your package to latest policy and set this control
N:   field appropriately.
N:   
N:   If the package is already compliant with the current standards, you
N:   don't have to re-upload the package just to adjust the
N:   Standards-Version control field. However, please remember to update
N:   this field next time you upload the package.

E: binary: binary-without-manpage hello
N:
N:   Each binary in /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /bin, /sbin, or /usr/games, must
N:   have a manual page.
N:   
N:   Note, that though the `man' program has the capability to check for
N:   several program names in the NAMES section, each of these programs
N:   must have its own manual page (a symbolic link to the appropriate
N:   manual page is sufficient) because other manual page viewers such as
N:   xman or tkman don't support this.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.1 for details.

W: binary: package-contains-upstream-install-documentation usr/share/doc/binary/INSTALL
N:
N:   Binary packages do not need to contain the instructions for building
N:   and installing the package as this info is not needed by package
N:   users. If the info contained is important for configuration perhaps it
N:   could be summarized in README.Debian, otherwise an override may be
N:   added.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.3 for details.
N:
E: binary: postinst-does-not-call-updatemenus usr/lib/menu/binary
N:
N:   Since the package installs a file in either /usr/lib/menu or
N:   /etc/menu-methods, the package should probably call the update-menus
N:   command in it's postinst script.
N:   
N:   For example, use the following code in your maintainer script:
N:    if [ -x /usr/bin/update-menus ] ; then update-menus ; fi
N:
E: binary: postrm-does-not-call-updatemenus usr/lib/menu/binary
N:
N:   Since the package installs a file in either /usr/lib/menu or
N:   /etc/menu-methods, the package should probably call the update-menus
N:   command in it's postrm script.
N:   
N:   For example, use the following code in your maintainer script:
N:    if [ -x /usr/bin/update-menus ] ; then update-menus ; fi
N:
E: binary: suidregister-used-in-maintainer-script postinst
N:
N:   This script calls suidregister which is no longer needed, a new
N:   command 'dpkg-statoverride' gives admins more flexibility. Please see
N:   the documentation of suidmanager and dpkg-statoverride for details.
N:
W: binary: menu-item-missing-important-tag section /usr/lib/menu/binary:1
N:
N:   The menu item has a line that is missing an important tag. It's likely
N:   that the line will have no effect without this tag. install-menu may
N:   report this as an error during package installation.
N:
E: binary: menu-item-adds-to-root-menu /usr/lib/menu/binary:1
N:
N:   The menu item has a line that specifies a section that will put a menu
N:   item right in the root menu. Packages should never add items directly
N:   to the root menu. Note that if you specify an empty section, this
N:   error will pop up, as it will if you specify a section of "/".
N:
E: binary: unstripped-binary-or-object ./usr/bin/hello
N:
N:   The package installs an unstripped binary or object file.
N:   
N:   Please note, that shared libraries have to be stripped with the
N:   --strip-unneeded option.
N:   
N:   Usually this is a bug. Otherwise, please contact
N:   lintian-maint@debian.org about this so that this exception would be
N:   recognized in future versions of Lintian.
N:
E: binary: statically-linked-binary ./usr/bin/hello-static
N:
N:   The package installs a statically linked binary or object file.
N:   
N:   Usually this is a bug. Otherwise, please contact
N:   lintian-maint@debian.org about this so that this exception would be
N:   recognized in future versions of Lintian.
N:
E: binary: changelog-file-not-compressed changelog
N:
N:   Changelog files must be compressed using `gzip -9'. Even if they start
N:   out small, they will become large with time.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.7 for details.
