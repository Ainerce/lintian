W: binary source: ancient-standards-version 3.2.1
N:
N:   The source package refers to a `Standards-Version' older than one
N:   year. Please update your package to latest policy and set this control
N:   field appropriately.
N:   
N:   If the package is already compliant with the current standards, you
N:   don't have to re-upload the package just to adjust the
N:   Standards-Version control field. However, please remember to update
N:   this field next time you upload the package.
N:
E: binary: binary-without-manpage hello
N:
N:   Each binary in /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /bin, /sbin, or /usr/games, must
N:   have a manual page.
N:   
N:   Note, that though the `man' program has the capability to check for
N:   several program names in the NAMES section, each of these programs
N:   must have its own manual page (a symbolic link to the appropriate
N:   manual page is sufficient) because other manual page viewers such as
N:   xman or tkman don't support this.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.1 for details.

W: binary: arch-dep-package-has-big-usr-share 1540kB 55%
N:
N:   The package has a significant amount of architecture-independent data
N:   in /usr/share, while it is an architecture-dependent package. This is
N:   wasteful of mirror space and bandwidth, as we then end up with
N:   multiple copies of this data, one for each architecture.
N:   
N:   If the data in /usr/share is not architecture-independent, it is a
N:   policy violation, and in this case, you should move that data
N:   elsewhere.

W: binary: package-contains-upstream-install-documentation usr/share/doc/binary/INSTALL
N:
N:   Binary packages do not need to contain the instructions for building
N:   and installing the package as this info is not needed by package
N:   users. If the info contained is important for configuration perhaps it
N:   could be summarized in README.Debian, otherwise an override may be
N:   added.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.3 for details.
N:
E: binary: postinst-does-not-call-updatemenus usr/lib/menu/binary
N:
N:   Since the package installs a file in either /usr/lib/menu or
N:   /etc/menu-methods, the package should probably call the update-menus
N:   command in it's postinst script.
N:   
N:   For example, use the following code in your maintainer script:
N:    if [ -x /usr/bin/update-menus ] ; then update-menus ; fi
N:
E: binary: postrm-does-not-call-updatemenus usr/lib/menu/binary
N:
N:   Since the package installs a file in either /usr/lib/menu or
N:   /etc/menu-methods, the package should probably call the update-menus
N:   command in it's postrm script.
N:   
N:   For example, use the following code in your maintainer script:
N:    if [ -x /usr/bin/update-menus ] ; then update-menus ; fi
N:
E: binary: suidregister-used-in-maintainer-script postinst
N:
N:   This script calls suidregister which is no longer needed, a new
N:   command 'dpkg-statoverride' gives admins more flexibility. Please see
N:   the documentation of suidmanager and dpkg-statoverride for details.
N:
W: binary: unquoted-string-in-menu-item /usr/lib/menu/binary needs:1
N:
N:   The menu item includes a tag with an unquoted string like
N:   section=Games instead of section="Games". This is deprecated. Use a
N:   quoted string instead.
N:   
N:   Refer to menu 3.1 for details.
N:
E: binary: menu-item-missing-required-tag section /usr/lib/menu/binary:1
N:
N:   The menu item has a line that is missing a required tag. It's likely
N:   that the line will have no effect without this tag. install-menu may
N:   report this as an error during package installation.
N:
W: binary: unquoted-string-in-menu-item /usr/lib/menu/binary needs:2
E: binary: su-to-root-without--c /usr/lib/menu/binary:2
N:
N:   The menu item command uses su-to-root without the -c flag. This is a
N:   syntax error, see su-to-root(1) for more information.
N:
E: binary: su-to-root-without--c /usr/lib/menu/binary:3
E: binary: su-to-root-without-usr-sbin /usr/lib/menu/binary:4
N:
N:   The menu item command use su-to-root without the full
N:   /usr/sbin/su-to-root path. The Woody version of menu does not have a
N:   su-to-root in a user's $PATH, unlike Sarge's version of menu.
N:   
N:   Therefore, the absolute pathname to su-to-root is still required for
N:   Sarge packages.
N:
E: binary: non-wm-in-windowmanager-menu-section x11 /usr/lib/menu/binary:4
N:
N:   The menu item is in the WindowManager section but does not needs=wm.
N:   Either it is a window manager and it should needs=wm, either it isn't
N:   and then it must be moved in another section.
N:
E: binary: su-to-root-with-usr-bin /usr/lib/menu/binary:5
N:
N:   The menu item command use su-to-root using /usr/bin/su-to-root.
N:   Usually, using absolute pathnames is bad. In this specific case
N:   however, you should use the absolute pathname of /usr/sbin/su-to-root.
N:   
N:   The reason for this is that the old Woody menu package had su-to-root
N:   exclusively in /usr/sbin, which is not in a regular user's $PATH.
N:   Therefore, the absolute pathname to su-to-root is still required for
N:   Sarge packages.
N:
W: binary: menu-item-needs-tag-has-unknown-value wm /usr/lib/menu/binary:5
N:
N:   The menu item has a line that has a needs= field with a strange value.
N:   This may be intentional, but it's probably a typo that will make menu
N:   ignore the line.
N:
E: binary: unstripped-binary-or-object ./usr/bin/hello
N:
N:   The package installs an unstripped binary or object file.
N:   
N:   Please note, that shared libraries have to be stripped with the
N:   --strip-unneeded option.
N:   
N:   Usually this is a bug. Otherwise, please contact
N:   lintian-maint@debian.org about this so that this exception would be
N:   recognized in future versions of Lintian.
N:
E: binary: statically-linked-binary ./usr/bin/static-hello
N:
N:   The package installs a statically linked binary or object file.
N:   
N:   Usually this is a bug. Otherwise, please contact
N:   lintian-maint@debian.org about this so that this exception would be
N:   recognized in future versions of Lintian, or install an override if
N:   your package is an exception. Note that binaries named *-static and
N:   *.static are already excluded, just as any binaries in packages named
N:   *-static.
N:
E: binary: changelog-file-not-compressed changelog
N:
N:   Changelog files must be compressed using `gzip -9'. Even if they start
N:   out small, they will become large with time.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.7 for details.
