W: relations source: ancient-standards-version 3.1.1
N:
N:   The source package refers to a `Standards-Version' older than one
N:   year. Please update your package to latest policy and set this control
N:   field appropriately.
N:   
N:   If the package is already compliant with the current standards, you
N:   don't have to re-upload the package just to adjust the
N:   Standards-Version control field. However, please remember to update
N:   this field next time you upload the package.
N:
E: relations source: build-depends-without-arch-dep
N:
N:   The control file specifies source relations for architecture-dependent
N:   packages, but no architecture-dependent packages are built. There are
N:   some exceptions, the most common is a Build-Depends: debhelper if you
N:   use dh_clean in the clean target of debian/rules. In other cases, you
N:   most likely need to change Build-Depends to Build-Depends-Indep.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 7.6 for details.
N:
E: relations source: bad-relation build-depends: foo (>> 2) bar baz bat
N:
N:   The package declares a relationship that could not be parsed according
N:   to the rules given in the Policy Manual.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 7.1 for details.
N:
W: relations source: redundant-origin-field
N:
N:   You use the Origin field though the field value is the default
N:   (Debian). In this case the field is redundant and should be removed.
N:
E: relations-multiple-libs: no-copyright-file
N:
N:   Each binary package has to include a plain file
N:   /usr/share/doc/<pkg>/copyright
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.5 for details.
N:
W: relations-multiple-libs: description-synopsis-might-not-be-phrased-properly
N:
N:   The synopsis (first line in the package "Description:" field, the
N:   short description) ends with a full stop "." character. This is not
N:   necessary, as the synopsis doesn't need to be a full sentence. It is
N:   recommended that a descriptive phrase is used instead.
N:   
N:   Note also that the synopsis is not part of the rest of the
N:   "Description:" field.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 3.4.1 for details.
N:
E: relations-multiple-libs: description-synopsis-is-duplicated
N:
N:   The first line of the extended Description: should not repeat the
N:   synopsis exactly. This indicates that either the synopsis is badly
N:   formed or that the extended description has been wrongly copied and
N:   pasted.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 3.4.2 for details.
N:
E: relations-multiple-libs: package-depends-on-multiple-libstdc-versions libstdc++2.10 libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 libstdc++3.0
N:
N:   The package seems to declare several relations to a libstdc version.
N:   This is not only sloppy but in the case of libraries, it may well
N:   break the runtime execution of programs.
N:
E: relations-multiple-libs: package-depends-on-multiple-tcl-versions tcl8.0 tcl8.2
N:
N:   The package seems to declare several relations to a tcl version. This
N:   is not only sloppy but in the case of libraries, it may well break the
N:   runtime execution of programs.
N:
E: relations-multiple-libs: package-depends-on-multiple-tk-versions tk8.2 tk8.3
N:
N:   The package seems to declare several relations to a tk version. This
N:   is not only sloppy but in the case of libraries, it may well break the
N:   runtime execution of programs.
N:
E: relations-multiple-libs: package-depends-on-multiple-tkx-versions tkx8.2 tkx8.3
N:
N:   The package seems to declare several relations to a tkx version. This
N:   is not only sloppy but in the case of libraries, it may well break the
N:   runtime execution of programs.
N:
E: relations-multiple-libs: package-depends-on-multiple-libpng-versions libpng2 libpng3
N:
N:   The package seems to declare several relations to a libpng version.
N:   This is not only sloppy but in the case of libraries, it may well
N:   break the runtime execution of programs.
N:
W: relations-multiple-libs: redundant-origin-field
E: relations-multiple-libs: obsolete-field bugs
N:
N:   This is one of the fields listed in Policy Manual as obsolete.
N:   
N:   Refer to policy D.2.6 for details.
N:
N: relations-multiple-libs binary: unknown-field-in-changes origin
E: relations: no-copyright-file
W: relations: package-relation-with-self depends: relations
N:
N:   The package declares a relationship with itself. This is not very
N:   useful, except in the case of a package Conflicting with itself, if
N:   its package name doubles as a virtual package.
N:
W: relations: package-relation-with-self depends: relations (<< 3)
E: relations: depends-on-essential-package-without-using-version depends: dpkg
N:
N:   The package declares a depends on an essential package i.e. dpkg
N:   without using a versioned depends. In general a package should not
N:   depend on essential packages but if it must do so, the depends should
N:   have a version string.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 3.5 for details.
N:
W: relations: virtual-package-depends-without-real-package-depends depends: mail-transport-agent
N:
N:   The package declares a depends on a virtual package without listing a
N:   real package as an alternative first.
N:   
N:   A real package should be listed in the first part of the | dependency
N:   in order for the package to be installable by package management
N:   programs that can't or won't guess which alternative to select by
N:   default. In particular, it helps build daemons rebuild the package
N:   without manual overrides.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 7.4 for details.
N:
E: relations: needlessly-depends-on-awk depends
N:
N:   The package seems to declare a relation on awk. awk is a virtual
N:   package, but it is special since it's de facto essential. If you don't
N:   need to depend on a specific version of awk (which wouldn't work
N:   anyway, as dpkg doesn't support versioned provides), you should remove
N:   the dependency on awk.
N:
E: relations: bad-version-in-relation conflicts: foobar (<< 5&5)
N:
N:   The version number used in this relationship does not match the
N:   defined format of a version number.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 5.6.11 for details.
N:
W: relations: package-relation-with-self replaces: relations
E: relations: package-has-a-duplicate-relation depends: relations, relations (<< 3)
N:
N:   The package seems to declare a relation on another package which is
N:   already implied by other relations it declares, and is therefore
N:   redundant. This is not only sloppy but can break some tools.
N:
W: relations: redundant-origin-field
E: relations: obsolete-field bugs
E: relations: obsolete-field optional
N: relations binary: unknown-field-in-changes origin
