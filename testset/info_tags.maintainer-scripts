W: maintainer-scripts source: ancient-standards-version 3.1.1
N:
N:   The source package refers to a `Standards-Version' older than one
N:   year. Please update your package to latest policy and set this control
N:   field appropriately.
N:   
N:   If the package is already compliant with the current standards, you
N:   don't have to re-upload the package just to adjust the
N:   Standards-Version control field. However, please remember to update
N:   this field next time you upload the package.

E: maintainer-scripts source: orphaned-package-should-not-have-uploaders
N:
N:   Packages which their maintainer set to packages@qa.debian.org, i.e.
N:   orphaned packages, should not have uploaders. Properly adopt the
N:   package if you want to resume its maintainance.
N:
W: maintainer-scripts source: qa-upload-has-incorrect-version-number 7-0.1
N:
N:   A QA upload (uploading an orphaned package without adopting it) is
N:   always a maintainer upload: it should not get a NMU revision number.
N:
W: maintainer-scripts source: changelog-should-mention-qa
N:
N:   If this upload is to orphan this package, please mention this fact on
N:   the first line of the changelog. If this is a QA upload, please
N:   mention "QA (group) upload" there.
N:
E: maintainer-scripts source: wrong-debian-qa-group-name QA group <packages@qa.debian.org>
N:
N:   Orphaned packages should have "Debian QA Group
N:   <packages@qa.debian.org>" in the maintainer field.
N:   
N:   Refer to Developers Reference, section 5.9.4 for details.

W: maintainer-scripts: postinst-should-not-set-usr-doc-link
N:
N:   The technical committee chose the symlink transition method to move
N:   from FSSTND to FHS. That transition has been completed with woody and
N:   thus this link is no longer required.
N:
W: maintainer-scripts: update-alternatives-remove-called-in-postrm
N:
N:   'update-alternatives --remove foo' is called in the postrm. This can
N:   be dangerous because at the time the postrm is executed foo has
N:   already been deleted and update-alternatives will ignore it while
N:   constructing its list of available alternatives. Then, if the
N:   /etc/alternatives symlink points at foo, update-alternatives won't
N:   recognize it and will mark the symlink as something site-specific. As
N:   such, the symlink will no longer be updated automatically and will be
N:   left dangling until `update-alternatives --auto ' is run by hand.
N:   
N:   update-alternatives --remove should be called in the prerm instead.
N:   
N:   If the postrm is the right place for what the package is doing, then
N:   please email lintian-maint@debian.org about it so that this exception
N:   would be recognized in future versions of Lintian.
N:
E: maintainer-scripts: maintainer-shell-script-fails-syntax-check prerm
N:
N:   Running this shell script with the shell's -n option set fails, which
N:   means that the script has syntax errors. This will likely make the
N:   package uninstallable.
N:   
N:   Run e.g. sh -n yourscript to see the errors yourself.
N:
W: maintainer-scripts: possible-bashism-in-maintainer-script prerm:19 '[ "$2" == '
N:
N:   This script is marked as running under /bin/sh, but it seems to use a
N:   feature found in bash.
N:   
N:   Examples: '==' in a test, it should use '=' instead 'read' without a
N:   variable in the argument 'function' to define a function 'source'
N:   instead of '.' '. command args', passing arguments to commands via
N:   'source' is not supported '{foo,bar}' instead of 'foo bar'
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 10.4 for details.

W: maintainer-scripts: postrm-has-useless-call-to-ldconfig
N:
N:   The postrm script calls ldconfig even though no shared libraries are
N:   installed in a directory controlled by the dynamic library loader.

N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 8.1.1 for details.

E: maintainer-scripts: no-copyright-file

N:
N:   Each Debian package (which provides a /usr/share/doc/<pkg> directory)

N:   /usr/share/doc/<pkg>/changelog.Debian.gz
N:
