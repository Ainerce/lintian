W: maintainer-scripts source: ancient-standards-version 3.1.1
N:
N:   The source package refers to a `Standards-Version' older than one
N:   year. Please update your package to latest policy and set this control
N:   field appropriately.
N:   
N:   If the package is already compliant with the current standards, you
N:   don't have to re-upload the package just to adjust the
N:   Standards-Version control field. However, please remember to update
N:   this field next time you upload the package.

W: maintainer-scripts: postinst-should-not-set-usr-doc-link
N:
N:   The technical committee chose the symlink transition method to move
N:   from FSSTND to FHS. That transition has been completed with woody and
N:   thus this link is no longer required.

W: maintainer-scripts: possible-bashism-in-maintainer-script postinst:12 '. /usr/share/lintian/shell foo'
N:
N:   This script is marked as running under /bin/sh, but it seems to use a
N:   feature found in bash.
N:   
N:   Examples: '==' in a test, it should use '=' instead 'read' without a
N:   variable in the argument 'function' to define a function 'source'
N:   instead of '.' '. command args', passing arguments to commands via
N:   'source' is not supported '{foo,bar}' instead of 'foo bar'
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 10.4 for details.

E: maintainer-scripts: maintainer-shell-script-fails-syntax-check prerm
N:
N:   Running this shell script with the shell's -n option set fails, which
N:   means that the script has syntax errors. This will likely make the
N:   package uninstallable.
N:   
N:   Run e.g. sh -n yourscript to see the errors yourself.

W: maintainer-scripts: update-alternatives-remove-called-in-postrm
N:
N:   'update-alternatives --remove foo' is called in the postrm. This can
N:   be dangerous because at the time the postrm is executed foo has
N:   already been deleted and update-alternatives will ignore it while
N:   constructing its list of available alternatives. Then, if the
N:   /etc/alternatives symlink points at foo, update-alternatives won't
N:   recognize it and will mark the symlink as something site-specific. As
N:   such, the symlink will no longer be updated automatically and will be
N:   left dangling until `update-alternatives --auto ' is run by hand.
N:   
N:   update-alternatives --remove should be called in the prerm instead.
N:   
N:   If the postrm is the right place for what the package is doing, then
N:   please email lintian-maint@debian.org about it so that this exception
N:   would be recognized in future versions of Lintian.
N:
E: maintainer-scripts: no-copyright-file
N:
N:   Each binary package has to include a plain file
N:   /usr/share/doc/<pkg>/copyright
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.5 for details.
