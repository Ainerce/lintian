W: libbaz source: ancient-standards-version 3.2.1
N:
N:   The source package refers to a `Standards-Version' older than one
N:   year. Please update your package to latest policy and set this control
N:   field appropriately.
N:   
N:   If the package is already compliant with the current standards, you
N:   don't have to re-upload the package just to adjust the
N:   Standards-Version control field. However, please remember to update
N:   this field next time you upload the package.

W: libbaz source: changelog-should-mention-nmu
N:
N:   When you NMU a package, that fact should be mentioned on the first
N:   line in the changelog entry.
N:
W: libbaz source: source-nmu-has-incorrect-version-number 1
N:
N:   A source NMU should have a Debian revision of '-x.x'. This is to
N:   prevent stealing version numbers from the maintainer (and the -x.x.x
N:   version numbers are reserved for binary-only NMU's).

E: libbaz1-dev: usr-doc-symlink-without-dependency libbaz1
N:
N:   If the package installs a symbolic link /usr/share/doc/<pkg1> ->
N:   <pkg2>, then <pkg1> has to depend on <pkg2> with the same version as
N:   <pkg1>.
N:   
N:   Note, that adding the "Depends:" entry just to fix this bug is not a
N:   good solution. It's suggested that you include a real
N:   /usr/share/doc/<pkg1> directory within <pkg1> and copy the copyright
N:   file into that directory.
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.5 for details.
N:
E: libbaz1: file-directly-in-usr-share-doc usr/share/doc/README.Debian
N:
N:   Documentation files have to be installed in /usr/share/doc/<pkg>
N:   
N:   Refer to Policy Manual, section 12.3 for details.
N:
W: libbaz1: zero-byte-file-in-doc-directory usr/share/doc/README.Debian
N:
N:   Package contains a file which is empty.
N:
W: libbaz1: postinst-should-not-set-usr-doc-link
N:
N:   The technical committee chose the symlink transition method to move
N:   from FSSTND to FHS. That transition has been completed with woody and
N:   thus this link is no longer required.
N:
E: libbaz1: maintainer-shell-script-fails-syntax-check postinst
N:
N:   Running this shell script with the shell's -n option set fails, which
N:   means that the script has syntax errors. This will likely make the
N:   package uninstallable.
N:   
N:   Run e.g. sh -n yourscript to see the errors yourself.
