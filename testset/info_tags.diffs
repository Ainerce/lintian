E: diffs source: debian-files-list-in-source
N:
N:   Leaving debian/files causes problems for the autobuilders, since that
N:   file will likely include the list of .deb files for another
N:   architecture, which will cause dpkg-buildpackage run by the buildd to
N:   fail.
N:   
N:   The clean rule for the package should remove this file.
N:
W: diffs source: configure-generated-file-in-source config.cache
N:
N:   Leaving config.cache/status causes autobuilders problems config.cache
N:   and config.status are produced by GNU autoconf's configure scripts. If
N:   they are left in the source package, autobuilders may pick up settings
N:   for the wrong architecture, causing problems.
N:   
N:   The clean rule in debian/rules should remove this file. This should
N:   ideally be done by fixing the upstream build system to do it when you
N:   run the appropriate cleaning command (and don't forget to forward the
N:   fix to the upstream authors so it doesn't happen in the next release).
N:   If that is already implemented, then make sure you are indeed cleaning
N:   it in the clean rule. If all else fails, a simple rm -f should work.
N:   
N:   Note that Lintian cannot reliably detect the removal in the clean
N:   rule, so once you fix this, please ignore or override this warning.

E: diffs: binary-without-manpage diffs
N:
N:   Each binary in /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /bin, /sbin, or /usr/games, must
N:   have a manual page.
N:   
N:   Note, that though the `man' program has the capability to check for
N:   several program names in the NAMES section, each of these programs
N:   must have its own manual page (a symbolic link to the appropriate
N:   manual page is sufficient) because other manual page viewers such as
N:   xman or tkman don't support this.
