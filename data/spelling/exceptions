# All spelling false-positive that have been observed "in the wild" in package
# descriptions are added here, on the grounds that if they occurred once they
# are more likely to occur again.

# Be careful with corrections that involve punctuation, since the check is a
# bit rough with punctuation.  For example, I had to delete the correction of
# "builtin" to "built-in".

# The format of each line is:

# Note that corrections involving multiple word mistakes or case errors
