# Known obsolete packages.  Not all packages are added to this list, only
# ones for which it's helpful for Lintian to warn about, such as
# significant transitions or transitional packages that we're trying to
# remove from the archive.
#
# Each list of packages should be tagged with the last Debian release in
# which the package appeared so that we can remove long-obsolete entries
# that are no longer worth checking for.
