# We intentionally do not include the multiarch directories like
# /lib/i486-linux-gnu since libraries installed there may be only for
# cross-compilation and not intended for the host operating system.  To
# determine whether they're for the host, we'd need to apply more complex
# logic to map the architecture of the Debian package to the appropriate
# multiarch directory name.
