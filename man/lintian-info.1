.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lintian-info

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B lintian-info
command parses the output of the
.B lintian
command and gives verbose information about the listed Lintian error
tags.
.sp
If no log-file is specified on the command line, this command expects
its input on stdin. Thus, the output of
.B lintian
can either be piped through
.B lintian-info
or a log file produced by
.B lintian
can be processed with this command. (Note, that the
.B lintian
command has a command line option
.B \-i
to automatically pipe its output through
.BR lintian-info .
Thus, you will rarely use this command directly.)

.SH EXIT STATUS
