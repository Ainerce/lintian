Not intended for single bug fixes, use the confirmed and owner tags
in the BTS, but for somewhat bigger tasks

goals for 1.22.12 [08.03.2004 - surely in Sarge]
================================================

- bring the bug count down (normal/minor) -- I think we've done
  this fairly well

goals for 1.23.0 [04.2004 - do we get it in Sarge?]
===================================================

- add .udeb support -- almost done, see 1.22.11+udeb branch
  (#216117)
- go through all checks and try to move common code to modules
- go through the test suite and organise it more cleanly
- perhaps already try to overhaul the Errors/Warnings concept
  (#197955, #189656)
- overhaul the overrides concept to enable source overrides
  (#129510)
- update debian/copyright. List of authors seems rather outdated

goals not targetted
===================

- #118170: [frontend] lintian needs lots of space in /tmp
  should be tackled, don't know when, though


old todo list
=============

reorganize regression suite:
  valid
  invalid
  <in between, odd, etc>

  whenever a check is touched or added, add a valid and invalid example

rewrite into a more sane layout.  What I would really like is a set of modules
that the controller script can open and use.  Probably some OO design.
I am leaning towards python, but will give OO perl a look first.

various items require the policy team to make a new policy or update existing
need to keep on them about this
  * libs v. plugins
  * X policy
