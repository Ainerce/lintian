reorganize regression suite:
  valid
  invalid
  <in between, odd, etc>

  whenever a check is touched or added, add a valid and invalid example

rewrite into a more sane layout.  What I would really like is a set of modules
that the controller script can open and use.  Probably some OO design.
I am leaning towards python, but will give OO perl a look first.

policy 3.5 updates, which means reading policy and ensuring lintian follows it
then I need to updater lintian to know about 3.5.

various items require the policy team to make a new policy or update existing
need to keep on them about this
  * libs v. plugins
  * X policy
