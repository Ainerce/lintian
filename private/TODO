Not intended for single bug fixes, use the confirmed and owner tags
in the BTS, but for somewhat bigger tasks

goals for 2.2.0
===============

- go through all checks and try to move common code to modules
  -- partly done
- overhaul the Errors/Warnings concept (#243976)
  -- mostly done
  We still need official support for alternative output formats.
  The current stuff is still experimental. [2.2.0?]
- add additional test suite types
  + normal TAP-style Perl tests
  + raw directories for building Debian packages via dpkg -b
  + changes files

goals not targetted
===================

- update doc/CREDITS file
- Go through testset/libbaz/debian/rules, and make sure all TODO's are
  lintian-detected
- go through all tags and make sure that any that should have Policy
  references have them, and more generally that appropriate references are
  present
- remove old unbalance `' quotes from all tag descriptions
- rewrite the Lintian manual in something other than DebianDoc-SGML
- update the Lintian manual
  + document severity/certainty
  + document other output formats
  + document the reporting framework
  + developer documentation of the test suite, submitting patches, etc.

goals outside of the lintian source
===================================

- set up system for automatically filing bugs based on specific lintian
  tags (the most reliable ones), with usertags to ensure the bugs aren't
  repeatedly filed
- set up lintian for use on ftp-master so that it can be used to
  automatically REJECT packages with particular errors.  will require a
  mode that only runs important checks that are highly reliable
  -- our side mostly done, needs to be implemented by ftp-master now

old todo list
=============

rewrite into a more sane layout.  What I would really like is a set of modules
that the controller script can open and use.  Probably some OO design.
I am leaning towards python, but will give OO perl a look first.
