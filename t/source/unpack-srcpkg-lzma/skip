Currently fails with:

unxz: (stdin): File format not recognized
tar: This does not look like a tar archive
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
dpkg-source: error: tar --no-same-owner --no-same-permissions -xkf - gave error exit status 2

because dpkg-source doesn't tell tar how to decompress the file.
