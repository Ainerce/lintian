TEST NAMING CONVENTIONS
=======================

Each test name should begin with the name of the part tested,
e.g.

<checkname>-...
<unpackname>-...
lintian-...
lintian-info-...

The .desc file names should start with a number to get a more
deterministic order. You do not need to use unique numbers, only
enough to make the order deterministic and to your liking!

Number ranges:

0000 - 0999	Basic test, that generally just assure that the test
		suite and lintian are not completly broken
1000 - 1999	Tests for lib/
2000 - 2999	Tests for frontend/
3000 - 3999	Tests for unpack/
4000 - 4999	Tests for collection/
5000 - 6999	Tests for checks/
7000 - 8999	<unused>
9000 - 9999	Tests for reporting/
