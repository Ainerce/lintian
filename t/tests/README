TEST NAMING CONVENTIONS
=======================

Each test name should begin with the name of the part tested,
e.g.

<checkname>-...
<unpackname>-...
lintian-...
lintian-info-...

Use generic- as a prefix for test cases that don't cover a
specific portion of Lintian but instead test Lintian's behavior
on a useful special case of package (such as a generic dh-make
template).

The .desc file names should start with a number to get a more
deterministic order. You do not need to use unique numbers, only
enough to make the order deterministic and to your liking!
You should use the middle of the assigned range as default
number and only divert from it if you have a reason to.

Number ranges:

0000 - 0999	Basic test, that generally just assure that the test
		suite and lintian are not completly broken
1000 - 1999	Tests for lib/       [1500]
2000 - 2999	Tests for frontend/  [2500]
3000 - 3999	Tests for unpack/    [3500]
4000 - 4999	Tests for collection/[4500]
5000 - 6999	Tests for checks/    [6000]
7000 - 8999	<unused>
9000 - 9999	Tests for reporting/ [9500]
