Testname: binaries-libc-link
Sequence: 6000
Version: 1.0
Description: Binaries not linked against libc
Architecture: any
# Ubuntu Precise emits so weird "readelf: Error: 'EXEC': No such file"
# errors. They appear from coll/hardening-info (or/and its helper).
# That makes hardening-check the likely suspect.  The version in Wheezy
# appears to work fine though, so presume >= 2.2 will work just fine.
