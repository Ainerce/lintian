lintian (1.24.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * checks/binaries:
    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect throughout rather than reparsing file-info
      and objdump-info.
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect instead of reading the fields/*, file-info
      and objdump-info files.
  * checks/copyright-file{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Drop the "copyright line too long" check.  Most of the issues
      it flags aren't easily fixable, particularly where the copyright file
      is (semi)automatically generated.  (Closes: #491302, #491365, #491685)
    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect for accessing control fields and reading the
      list of files in the package.
    + [ADB] Don't flag use of version 1 of the GPL, or licenses using phrases
      such as "compatible with the GPL" (for example, the W3C Software
      License) as missing a reference to common-licenses
  * checks/cruft:
    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect for accessing control fields
  * checks/debconf:
    + [ADB] Don't complain about unused debconf templates in udebs.
      (Closes: #491135)
    + [RA] Try to recognize at least some debconf template uses in Perl.
    + [ADB] Replace fields/* and scripts access with Lintian::Collect
    + [ADB] Don't flag the shared templates used for dictionaries-common
      co-ordination as unused.
    + [FL] Remove debconf-error-requires-versioned-depends since post-lenny
      a tag for the sake of sarge-backports clearly makes no sense anymore.
      (Closes: #493920)
  * checks/description:
    + [RA] Don't warn about a synopsis that ends in "etc."  Patch from
      Chris Lamb.  (Closes: #491252)
  * checks/etcfiles:
    + [ADB] Walk Lintian::Collect->index instead of reading the "index" file.
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Warn about packages that depend exclusively on makedev.
      Thanks, Josh Triplett.  (Closes: #491625)
    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect::field() to determine the content of fields
      from control files rather than reading the fields/* files. This and
      similar changes to other scripts should improve performance as the
      Collect object caches the lookup result.
  * checks/files{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Switch to using Lintian::Collect.
    + [ADB] Fix a couple of bugs in the parsing of the list of scripts
      contained within a package which led to scripts in /usr/share/doc
      being incorrectly tagged as executable-in-usr-share-doc.
    + [ADB] Update a couple of Policy references.  Thanks Jordà Polo.
    + [ADB] Warn when a package embeds a copy of the Universal Feed Parser.
      Patch from Chris Lamb.  (Closes: #493156)
    + [FL, ADB] Don't issue tag file-in-unusal-dir for files where we already
      issued one of the specific dir-or-file-in-* tags.  (Closes: #493921)
  * checks/huge-usr-share:
    + [ADB] Replace (the single) direct access to fields/* with ::field()
    + [ADB] Replace an outdated link to the Developer's Reference.
      Thanks Jordà Polo.
  * checks/infofiles{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect to retrieve information about the files
      being processed.
    + [ADB] Update the tag "install-info-not-called-with-quiet-option"'s
      Policy reference.  Thanks Jordà Polo.
  * checks/init.d.desc:
    + [ADB] Update a Policy reference.  Thanks Jordà Polo.
  * checks/lintian.desc:
    + [ADB] Add a Policy reference to bad-section-in-changes-file.  Thanks
      Jordà Polo.
  * checks/manpages{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Suppress warnings about inability to break a line that contains
      a URL.  URLs often can't be usefully broken.  Based on a patch by
      Damyan Ivanov.  (Closes: #491578)
    + [ADB] Update the Policy reference for manpage-has-wrong-extension.
    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect rather than parsing the "index" and
      "file-info" files.
    + [FL] In description for manpage-has-errors-from-man note how to
      reproduce this errors outside of lintian.  (Closes: #492930)
  * checks/menu-format{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect to parse the list of files in the package.
    + [ADB] Don't raise menu-command-not-in-package for 'sensible-browser'
      or 'sh'.  Thanks Raphael Geissert.
    + [RA] Warn about .kdelnk files and [KDE Desktop Entry] headings in
      desktop files.  Patch from Raphael Geissert.
  * checks/menus{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Fix a typo; thanks Jordà Polo.
    + [ADB] Use the file list from Lintian::Collect.
  * checks/nmu{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Use Lintian::Collect for maintainer / uploader information
    + [ADB] Add a DevRef reference to changelog-should-mention-nmu.  Thanks
      Jordà Polo.
  * checks/patch-systems:
    + [RA] Combine all patch-system-but-direct-changes-in-diff instances
      into a single message to reduce the noise from packages that rebuild
      all auto-generated files outside the patch system.  Thanks, Julien
      Cristau.  (Closes: #491296)
    + [ADB] Migrate fields/* reading to use ::Collect::field().
  * checks/po-debconf{,.desc}:
    + [ADB] Check that at least one complete translation exists.  Thanks Jordà
      Polo.
  * checks/rules:
    + [ADB] Use ::Collect for field access.
  * checks/scripts{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Warn about maintainer scripts that prepend a path to commands.
      Based on a patch by Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #376184)
    + [ADB] Don't read fields/*, scripts, index or file-info directly as the
      contents have almost certainly been cached in Lintian::Collect already.
    + [ADB] Update a couple of Policy references.  Thanks Jordà Polo.
  * checks/shared-libs.{,desc}:
    + [ADB] Improve the description of no-symbols-control-file.
    + [ADB] Migrate to using ::Collect instead of parsing the index, file-info
      and objdump-info files directly.
    + [ADB] Disable ldconfig-symlink-before-shlib-in-deb as it can never be
      tested correctly using the information currently available to the
      scripts
  * checks/watch-file:
    + [FL] Do not issue debian-watch-file-should-mangle-version for
      empty watch files.

  * data/doc-base/sections:
    + [ADB] Resynchronize with doc-base's section list (adding
      Programming/OCaml).  (Closes: #491440)

  * doc/desc-files:
    + [ADB] Update the description of tags to include experimental and info
      tags.
  * doc/README:
    + [ADB] Add -E / --show-experimental to the option list
  
  * frontend/lintian:
    + [FL] Add new --tags/-T option to limit the amount of checks
      run not by check names but by names of tags you're interested
      in. This will not suppress other tags in the selected checks!
      Requested by Joerg Jaspert for ftpmaster.  (Closes: #493903)
    + [FL] Add --tags-from-file option to make it easier to specify
      a long list of tags.

  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Binary.pm:
    + [ADB] When parsing objdump-info, indicate whether a shared object is
      an Ocaml executable.  Also add information on segments which various
      checks scripts use which hadn't made it here yet.
    + [ADB] Make index() return a hash rather than an array
    + [ADB] Add support for parsing the "scripts" index file

      previously weren't tested)
  * testset/tags.scripts{,.sed}:
    + [ADB] Munge .changes filenames so that the tests produce consistent
      output across architectures

      using "__Choices" instead (Closes: #481152)
    + [ADB] Check all maintainer scripts for issues, rather than just config
      and postinst.
    + [ADB] Detect debconf templates which appear to be unused.
    + [ADB] Replace the {config,postinst}-loads-obsolete-confmodule tags
      with a new loads-obsolete-confmodule test which is used for all
      maintainer scripts and outputs the script name as part of its extra data.
  * checks/description{,.desc}:
    + [RA] Warn about duplicated words in the description.  Patch from
      Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #424746)
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Do not complain about obsolete packages if there are
      non-obsolete alternatives specified and if the obsolete
      package is not listed first.  Issue an info tag for them
      though.  Patch by Adam D. Barratt.  (Closes: #486145)

    + [ADB] Treat 00list* as dpatch series files rather than just 00list.
      (Closes: #482040). Also rename dpatch-index-references-non-existant-patch

      #175467.  Patch by Raphael Geissert.
    + [FL] Remove "quoted quotes". They're likely to be inside
      another pair of quotes; we're not interested in

      Adam D. Barratt.

    + [ADB] Implement syntax and sanity checking for symbols files
      (Closes: #452216)
    + [ADB] Check symbols files for dependencies that are not satisfied by
      the package itself (Closes: #461575)
  * checks/standards-version{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Only issue out-of-date-standards-version once.  Noticed by
      Raphael Geissert.
    + [RA] Base the two-year clock for ancient-standards-version on when
      the Policy version was superseded, not when it was issued.  Thanks,
      Scott Kitterman.  (Closes: #487780)
    + [RA] Warn for packages declaring a standards version released after
      the date of the most recent changelog entry.  Based on a patch by
      Raphael Geissert.
  * checks/watch-file{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Check for more Debian specific strings in version

      uversionsmangle to add the Debian specific string. Patch
      by Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #485879)
    + [RA] Warn about watch files in native packages and check those watch
      files for other problems anyway.  Allow whitespace around the
      version declaration.  More correctly handle continuation lines.
      Patch from Raphael Geissert.
    + [RA] Check for using the Sourceforge QA redirector with deprecated
      arguments.  Patch from Raphael Geissert.
    + [RA] Be more explicit when warning about missing watch files that
      Lintian recommends adding a watch file containing only comments for
      any non-native package where it's not possible to write a meaningful
      watch file, not only for packages unmaintained upstream.

  * collection/objdump-info:
    + [ADB] If objdump from binutils 2.17 fails to parse a file then
      attempt to gather the required information using readelf instead.

      (i.e. on lintian.d.o)  (Closes: #487746)

  * data/fields/obsolete-packages:
    + [RA] mailx is not obsolete.  It's a virtual package.  Thanks, martin
      f krafft.  (Closes: #488114)
    + [RA] Add the cupsys packages, all of which have been renamed to cups.
      Patch from Raphael Geissert.
  
  * debian/control:
    + [FL] Adapt VCS-* headers for move from SVN to git.
  * debian/copyright:
    + [FL] Add Patrick Schoenfeld (for checks/watch-file).
    + [ADB] Update repository information and GPL2 URL.

      expand initials in the changelog.
  * debian/{prerm,postrm}:
    + [RA] Move prerm to postrm and remove the default /var/spool/lintian
      lab using shell instead of lintian.  We only want to remove the lab
      on purge, and purge is only passed to postrm, not prerm, by which
      point the lintian frontend is gone.  (Closes: #489860)
  
  * doc/CREDITS:
    + [FL] Add Raphael Geissert and Adam D. Barratt.
  * doc/lintian.sgml:
    + [ADB] Add reference to new option to display experimental tags.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [ADB] Add a new --show-experimental / -E option which indicates
      that experimental tags should be displayed.
    + [RA] Exit with the correct exit status if no packages were found
      because non-existent packages were specified on the command line.

  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Binary.pm:
    + [FL] Add support for file-info file.
    + [FL] Add support for objdump-info file.
  * lib/Spelling.pm:

      checks for LaTeX and TeX.  Thanks, Raphael Geissert.

    + [ADB] (Re-)Add support for experimental tags.
  
  * man/lintian.1:
    + [FL] Document watch-file check.
    + [ADB] Document new option to display experimental tags.
    + [RA] Refer to lintian-info(1) for printing tag descriptions.  Patch
      from Chris Lamb.  (Closes: #490374)
  
  * reporting/harness:
    + [ADB] Process packages using -E so that experimental tags are included.
  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [FL] Mark the tag pages with the correct code.
  * reporting/lintian.css:

    + [FL] Mark overridden tags.
    + [RA] Mark packages that override all instances of a given tag.
      Patch from Jordà Polo.
  * reporting/templates/maintainer.tmpl:
    + [FL] Add useful links for each source package.
      With layout help by Jordà Polo.
    + [FL] Include Co-maintained packages in the summary
      at the top of the page.  Also sort the list.  Patch
      by Jordà Polo.
    + [ADB] Note that the full report includes experimental tags.

  * testset/runtests:
    + [ADB] Support experimental tags

lintian (1.24.1) unstable; urgency=medium
  
  The "mostly for the benefit of lintian.debian.org only" release.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [FL] Increase LAB_FORMAT to 8. This should have happened
      in 1.23.47, since the unpack-binpkg-l1 then produced a
      new file which checks depend upon.  Since this only
      affects static labs and only if packages get rechecked
      (i.e. not on harness -i runs) it only got noticed now.
      Use urgency=medium for this fix.
  
  * checks/watch-file:
    + [FL] Fix the order of two regular expression to use
      the more specific one first.  Patch by Raphael Geissert.
      (Closes: #485884)
  
  * unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1:
    + [FL] Don't include version number from Source: field in
      the source symlink.  Noted by RA.  (Closes: #485474)
  
  * lib/Lintian/Collect/Binary.pm:
    + [FL] New module for retrieving binary package information.
  
  * reporting/checkout-release:
    + [FL] New helper script for lintian.d.o maintenance.
  * reporting/config:
    + [FL] Generate files in $HOME/www directly instead
      of $HOME/www/reports.
  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [FL] Allow inclusion of the new shared templates by
      convenient functions. Remove some duplicated data
      setting while I'm on it.
    + [FL] Generate the manual and lintian.log symlinks
      dynamically, so that we don't need the reports subdirectory
      anymore.  Also generate a reports -> . symlink for
      backwards compatibility.
  * reporting/templates/{head,foot}.tmpl:
    + [FL] New templates meant for inclusion by other templates
      for common header and footer parts
  * reporting/templates/index.tmpl:
    + [FL] Remove obsolete reports/ subdirectory from the links.    
  * reporting/templates/maintainer.tmpl:
    + [RA] Redisplay the tag name for each separate binary package, also
      fixing list nesting problems in some cases.  Patch from Jordà
      Polo.
  * reporting/templates/*.tmpl:
    + [FL] Replace common headers/footers with calls to the
      new head()/foot() functions.

lintian (1.24.0) unstable; urgency=low

  The "Policy 3.8.0, infrastructure evolution, and real web design"
  release.
  
  * checks/binaries:
    + [RA] Fix code for filtering out NSS modules from SONAME checks.
    + [RA] When checking SONAMEs against package names, convert all
      underscores to dashes, not just the first one.  Thanks, Gonéri Le
      Bouder.  (Closes: #482450)
    + [RA] Remove several-sonames-in-same-package.  This is frequently not
      an error and Lintian doesn't have enough information to know.
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [RA] armel is now a standard architecture.
    + [RA] Remove %known_obsolete_packages, now handled via data.
    + [RA] Merge %non_standard_archs into %known_archs.
  * checks/control-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for self-dependencies in the source package since the
      current dpkg-gencontrol silently fixes them but they may indicate
      other problems.  Thanks, Patrick Matthäi.  (Closes: #471740)
  * checks/copyright-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for copyright files containing the Apache 2.0 license,
      which is now in common-licenses.
  * checks/cruft:
    + [RA] Format: 3.0 (quilt) packages are not native even though they
      have no *.diff.gz.  Thanks, Raphael Hertzog.  (Closes: #483384)
    + [RA] Use the new Lintian::Collect interface to check whether a
      package is native.
  * checks/debconf:
    + [RA] Don't warn about using db_input in postinst if a config script
      also exists and uses db_input.  The package maintainer probably
      knows what they're doing.
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Syntax-check Breaks like other relationship fields.  Warn if
      any packages use Breaks for right now.  Only check for duplicate
      libraries and Tcl versions in dependency fields, not Breaks,
      Conflicts, and other similar fields.  Warn if Breaks is used without
      a version.  Check that Breaks is not inconsistent with other
      dependency fields.
    + [RA] Use Lintian::Data to load the obsolete package list.
    + [RA] When checking whether a debug package has proper dependencies,
      allow a dependency on any package name that starts the same as the
      debug package up to the first dash.  This will hopefully produce
      fewer false positives.  Thanks, Josselin Mouette.  (Closes: #476587)
    + [RA] Remove non-standard-architecture-in-source-relation and
      non-standard-architecture.  These aren't bugs.
  * checks/filenames{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Warn about BTS data directories in packages (.be and
      .ditrack).  Patch by Ben Finney.  (Closes: #481787)
  * checks/init.d:
    + [RA] Try to allow for postinst scripts written in Perl and still
      recognize the update-rc.d calls.
  * checks/manpages{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Only ignore errors about wrapping lines for Asian locale man
      pages, since that's where the groff trouble lies.  Ignore character
      set errors for all man pages with old versions of man and no man
      pages with current versions of man since the new character set
      handling should cope.  (Closes: #474052)
    + [FL] Ignore more unicode issues with old man.
    + [RA] Warn about inclusion of the country name in the localized man
      page directory unless it's one of the known exceptions.
    + [RA] Mention in binary-without-manpage that the case of the man page
      should match the case of the binary even if man can find it anyway.
      (Closes: #484028)
  * checks/md5sums:
    + [FL] Don't complain about missing md5sums file if the
      package only contains conffiles.  (Closes: #482869)
  * checks/nmu:
    + [RA] Don't treat "Ack NMU" as an NMU declaration.  Thanks, Joe
      Nahmias.  (Closes: #484600)
    + [RA] Binary NMUs of QA-maintained packages are fine.
  * checks/rules{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add some basic checks for whether debhelper programs are called

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [FL] Don't issue a warning about Distribution: UNRELEASED in

    + [RA] Issue errors for installing files under /var/www.  This isn't

    + [RA] Add clisp, procmail, and rrdcgi, and another way interpretors
      are templated in *.in files.
    + [RA] Expect unversioned dependencies on OCaml packages rather than
      versioned dependencies since the version changes frequently and

      Hideki Yamane.  (Closes: #476417)
    + [RA] Add inetutils-inetd and xinetd as additional update-inetd
      providers.  Patch from Guillem Jover.  (Closes: #474077)

      respects.

  * checks/files{.desc,}:

    + [RA] Don't rely on the output format of dpkg-source to learn the
      source directory and create a symlink.  Instead, tell dpkg-source to
      unpack the source directly into the unpacked directory.  Discard
      output of dpkg-source to allow for the current version, which prints
      things even with -q (fixed in later versions).  Thanks, Raphael

lintian (1.23.43) unstable; urgency=low

  The "37 bug fixes is enough for one release" release.

  * checks/binaries{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Don't require objdump's errors on files with bad dynamic tables
      to start at the beginning of the line.  Patch from Chris Lamb.
      (Closes: #459509)
    + [RA] Warn for packages that have binaries requiring libc but which
      don't depend on libc.  Patch from Niko Tyni.  (Closes: #461350)
    + [RA] Remove check for libc5 binaries.  libc5 is long-gone.
    + [RA] Remove various dead tag descriptions we no longer issue.
    + [RA] Warn on packages that provide Perl modules but don't depend on
      perlapi-*.  Thanks, Niko Tyni.  (Closes: #463142)
    + [RA] Check files in /usr/lib/debug directories mirroring the main
      file system to verify they are detached debugging symbols and not
      full libraries or executables.  Thanks, Neil Williams and Niko
      Tyni.  (Closes: #462456)
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [RA] Decode the changelog entry from UTF-8 before doing length
      checks.  Thanks, Cyril Brulebois.  (Closes: #461822)
    + [RA] Check for mismatches between the latest changelog and
      NEWS.Debian entries if they're for the same package version.
      Thanks, Cyril Brulebois.  (Closes: #461823)
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [RA] Add Bugs, Origin, and Breaks to known binary and udeb fields
      and Bugs to known source fields, matching current dpkg.  Thanks,
      Raphaël Hertzog.  (Closes: #459787)
  * checks/debhelper:
    + [RA] CDBS now defaults to a debhelper compatibility level of V5.
    + [FL] Update list of debhelper commands that modify maintainer
       scripts. Add dh_icons, dh_installudev, dh_pysupport, dh_pycentral
       and rename dh_installtexfonts to dh_installtex.
    + [RA] Add checks for versioned debhelper dependencies for dh_icons
      and dh_installifupdown.  Thanks, Evgeni Golov.  (Closes: #463028)
  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] The CDBS ant rules are in class, not rules.  Thanks, Cyril
      Brulebois.  (Closes: #460168)
    + [RA] Versioned Python dependencies satisfy a Python debian/rules
      requirement.  Add a separate tag for Python build dependencies to
      explain the dependency possibilities.  Ignore dh_python if
      debian/pyversion or a Python-Version control field are present.
      Thanks, Loïc Minier.  (Closes: #460625)
    + [RA] Check that -dbg packages depend on their base package.  Patch
      from Chris Lamb.  (Closes: #458785)
    + [RA] Check the value of Dm-Upload-Allowed.
    + [RA] Warn about packages with a list as the maintainer and no
      Uploaders.  Thanks, Sune Vuorela.  (Closes: #462635)
    + [RA] Remove the package-has-duplicate-relation test.  It gets
      relations with different version strictness in different levels of
      dependency wrong and what it gets right dpkg-gencontrol strips out.
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] In many of the long descriptions for symlink-related tags,
      mention that running dh_link will fix symlink problems.
    + [RA] Fix a long-standing error in the regex checking for *.desktop
      files in /usr/share/gnome/apps that caused the tag to never be
      issued.  Remove the check for /usr/share/applnk, since obsolete or
      not KDE appears to actively use it still.
    + [RA] Check for *.devhelp{2,} files not linked into devhelp's search
      path.  Based on a patch by Bradley Smith.  (Closes: #273309)
    + [RA] Warn about /etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly} scripts that

      Chris Lamb.  (Closes: #459502)
    + [RA] Warn of more language extensions on files in the user's path.
      Patch from Chris Lamb.  (Closes: #459514)
    + [RA] Remove the tag for empty Perl directories.  The underlying
      issue is fixed in Perl 5.10; there's no need to add code to
      debian/rules when 5.10 is landing soon.  (Closes: #463138)
  * checks/infofiles:
    + [RA] Don't issue unknown-intepreter for maintainer scripts with

      wasn't defined.  Thanks, Thijs Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #460964)
    + [RA] Fix Perl warnings given a zero-byte maintainer script.  Thanks,
      Thijs Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #460966)

      it's not required for functionality.  Thanks, Petter Reinholdtsen.
      (Closes: #460499)
  * checks/manpages{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Make hyphen-used-as-minus-sign more conservative to avoid false
      positives with non-ASCII text and catch hyphens at the start of
      lines.  Thanks, Michal Čihař.  (Closes: #459871)
    + [CW] Use man's new --warnings option to catch use of undefined
      strings, macros, or diversions in manual pages, which usually indicate
      mistaken use of "." or "'" at the start of a line. This check is only
      enabled if man 2.5.1 or later is installed.  (Closes: #377392)
  * checks/menu-format:
    + [RA] Avoid a Perl warning for desktop entries without Exec.
    + [RA] Fix a bug that prevented Exec keys in desktop files from being
      checked at all.  Thanks, Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #462601)
    + [RA] Exempt packages providing the su wrappers from the check for
      using su-to-root.  Thanks, Raphael Geissert.
  * checks/menus:
    + [RA] Don't issue unknown-interpreter for maintainer scripts with
      weird interpreters.
    + [RA] Fix Perl warnings given a zero-byte maintainer script.
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [RA] Exclude from not-using-po-debconf template files with only the
      shared templates used for coordination with dictionaries-common.
      Thanks, Thomas Bushnell BSG.  (Closes: #460731)
  * checks/rules.desc:
    + [RA] To fix an ignores-make-clean-error, suggest removing "-" for
      static makefiles.  Thanks, Andrea Colangelo.  (Closes: #458164)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Re-add php4-cli as a valid interpreter for those who want to
      maintain stable compatibility.  Thanks, Thomas Goirand.
    + [RA] Be clearer in the tag name that php-cli dependencies should be
      versioned.  Add more explanation to the long description of several
      interpreter tags about limitations and requested bug filings.
    + [RA] Remove tcl as a valid interpreter since tclx8.3 is obsolete.
      (tclsh is the standard interpreter name.)
    + [RA] Require versioned dependencies for OCaml scripts.  Each version
      is ABI-incompatible.  Thanks, Samuel Mimram.  (Closes: #462065)
    + [RA] Add tcl and tk metapackages.  Thanks, Sergei Golovan.
      (Closes: #463281)
    + [RA] Catch exec wrappers that use $* instead of $@ (not that this is
      a good idea).  Thanks, Adam D. Barratt.  (Closes: #463476)
    + [RA] Integrate several more bashism checks from checkbashisms in
      devscripts.  Patch from Adam D. Barratt.  (Closes: #464026)

  * debian/control:
    + [RA] Suggest man-db >= 2.5.1 for better warning support.
    + [RA] Wrap Uploaders.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Include info tags in the broken-down description of the
      override count since they're included in the total.  Based on a
      patch by Chris Lamb.  (Closes: #459851)
    + [RA] Don't try to report overrides when not checking a package.
      Thanks, Håkon Stordahl.  (Closes: #461978)
    + [RA] Cope with a relative path to the lab.  Patch from Håkon
      Stordahl.  (Closes: #461982)
    + [RA] Don't require *.changes files for source-only uploads to have a
      Description field.  Thanks, Cyril Brulebois.  (Closes: #462586)

  * lib/Spelling.pm:
    + [RA] Add spelling corrections for PostgreSQL and OCaml and lots of
      new capitalization corrections.  (Closes: #460347)

lintian (1.23.42) unstable; urgency=low

  The "what did you do on your Christmas vacation?" release.

  * checks/binaries:
    + [RA] Don't warn about unstripped binaries in .../lib/debug.  Some
      packages include debugging symbols in the main package.

      Wijnen.  (Closes: #456318)

  * checks/cruft:
    + [RA] Ignore debian/config.cache.
  * checks/debconf{.desc,}:
    + Remove partially-translated-question at the request of Christian
      Perrier.  Only the translator could fix this, and debconf doesn't
      show the translation unless it's complete.  (Closes: #459293)
  * checks/debian-readme{.desc,}:
    + Combine readme-debian-{is,contains}-debmake-template and be less
      particular about the exact formatting of the dh-make template.

      Thanks, Joerg Jaspert.  (Closes: #458074)

      and Live CD support.  Thanks, Daniel Baumann.  (Closes: #453931)

      ones elsewhere are too strange.  (Closes: #459252)

      picky spelling and capitalization checks on the abstract and title
      fields.
  * checks/patch-systems:
    + [RA] dpatch permits multiple patches to be listed on the same line
      of 00list.  Patch by Chris Lamb.  (Closes: #457523)

    + [RA] Add lua40 and lua5.1.  Thanks, Enrico Tassi.  (Closes: #457219)
    + [RA] Improve recognition of heredocs.
    + [RA] Recognize quoted strings that start at beginning of the line.
    + [RA] Rewrite script path and dependency checking.  Remove scripts
      and packages no longer in the archive.  Add new versions of
      versioned scripts and packages.  Fix the dependencies for pike
      interpreters.  (Closes: #458896)
    + [RA] Reformat long descriptions and collapse some tags.
    + [RA] For consistent results, only syntax-check sh and bash scripts.
      Also ignore all dpatch files, not just those in /usr/src.

      Fritsch.  (Closes: #454790)
    + [RA] Check that the argument to --color is valid.

    + [RA] Allow for HTML color tags.
    + [RA] Add -a to annotate an override file.

  * lib/Dep.pm:
    + [RA] Allow substvars instead of package names so that dependency
      checks against the source debian/control file don't treat all
      substvars as equivalent.  Thanks, Julien Cristau.  (Closes: #456802)
  * lib/Spelling.pm:
    + [RA] Stop doing capitalization checks on all files; there's too much
      of a risk of false positives.  Instead, provide a separate picky
      spelling check function for package descriptions and similar cases
      where we're more sure of the contents.
    + [RA] Expand the picky capitalization checks to catch Debian, GNOME,
      KDE, and Linux.  (Closes: #456582)

      - Correctly handle multiple different maintainer strings with the
        same e-mail address.

  The "it would be lovely if there were an actual desktop file standard"
  release.

      - warn about non-absolute URLs
  * checks/menu-format{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add Actions to the KDE-specific desktop file keys.  Add
      Application as an acceptable Main Category even though it's not
      listed in the standard; given how widely it's used, it doesn't
      appear to be worth warning about right now.  (Closes: #444651)
    + [RA] Add GNUstep as an acceptable Main Category, since it's used as
      a non-standard category by GNUstep applications.
    + [RA] Warn about desktop files containing CRLF line endings (and then
      strip the CR for later checks).  The standard is explicit that each
      line ends in only LF.
  
  * debian/control:
    + [FL] Add liburi-perl to Depends for the Homepage checks.
    + [RA] Wrap Depends for readability.

  * testset/runtests:

      only one changelog entry), warn if it doesn't close a bug.  Thanks,
      Margarita Manterola.  (Closes: #356051)

    + [RA] Ignore Original-Maintainer if the version contains ubuntu.

    + [RA] Ignore the gf suffix from the gfortran migration when checking
      whether the package name matches the SONAME.  Thanks, Kevin
      B. McCarty.  (Closes: #448207)
  * checks/changelog-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check that the latest changelog entry has a later version than
      the previous entry.  Thanks, Thijs Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #449257)
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [RA] Add Dm-Upload-Allowed as a control field.  (Closes: #453779)
  * checks/control-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Diagnose stronger dependencies that imply weaker dependencies,
      such as the same dependency in both Depends and Recommends or
      Recommends and Suggests.  Thanks, Joerg Jaspert.  (Closes: #453302)
    + [RA] Upgrade no-section-field-for-source to warning at the request
      of Joerg Jaspert.
  * checks/control-files:
    + [RA] Add symbols as a known control file for debs and udebs.
  * checks/copyright-file:
    + [HE] Check that encoding of copyright file is UTF-8. Patch by
           gregor herrmann <gregor+debian@comodo.priv.at>. (Closes: #451689)
    + [HE] Add warning copyright-contains-dh_make-todo-boilerplate
           if the maintainer left the dh_make boilerplate in the
           copyright file. Based on patch by Cyril Brulebois
           <cyril.brulebois@enst-bretagne.fr>. (Closes: #448677)
    + [RA] Check for the complete GFDL included in the copyright file and
      expand copyright-file-contains-full-gpl-license to look for GPL v3
      references.  Also check for correct references to common-licenses
      for the GFDL and LGPL.
  * checks/deb-format:
    + [HE] Remove, not needed any more. (Closes: #447257)
  * checks/debconf:
    + [HE] Explicitly allow the phrase "no longer" in boolean debconf
      questions. (Closes: #447718)
  * checks/description.desc:
    + [RA] Upgrade the legacy Homepage tag to a warning.
  * checks/fields:
    + [HE] Add 'doc-package-should-be-section-doc',
           'python-package-should-be-section-python',
           'perl-package-should-be-section-perl'. Ideas shamelessy
           stolen from linda. (Closes: #452839)
    + [RA] Allow Python dependencies in Build-Depends when using another
      variant for calling Python in the clean target.  Thanks, Bernd
      Zeimetz.  (Closes: #444642)
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [HE,RA] Add 'package-contains-empty-directory' check, but ignore
      dirs in /var and /etc and handle /usr/lib/perl5 and /usr/share/perl5
      directories separately with a lower priority level since they're
      very common.  (Closes: #452316, #357838)
    + [HE] Add checks for game packages that contain no game executables
           (package-section-games-but-contains-no-game) or that contain
           anything in usr/bin at all, which is usually a mistake.
           (package-section-games-but-contains-no-game). (Closes: #451668)
    + [RA] Downgrade symlink-should-be-relative to a warning since it's a
      Policy should.  Thanks, Thijs Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #454239)
  * checks/lintian.desc:
    + [RA] Add critical as a recognized urgency.
  * checks/patch-systems:
    + [HE] Add complete new check script, intended to check for usual
           problems when using patch systems. Start with three
           checks for common dpatch problems. Idea loosely based on
           patch by Carl Fürstenberg <azatoth@gmail.com>. (Closes: #437959)
  * checks/po-debconf.desc:
    + [RA] not-using-po-debconf is now an error per Policy section 3.9.1.
  * checks/rules:
    + [HE] Implement 'binary-arch-rules-but-pkg-is-arch-indep', checking
           for rules in binary-arch when the package is arch: all.
           (Closes: #409109, #119097)
    + [HE] Implement 'desktop-file-but-no-dh_desktop-call', checking for
           missing dh_desktop calls when .desktop files are installed in
           a debhelperized package. (Closes: #409138)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [HE] Allow packages to drop snippets into /etc/csh/login.d
           without a dependency on csh. Files there should also
           be allowed to have csh in the shebang line. (Closes: #453417)
    + [HE] Allow packages to drop snippets into /etc/fish.d/ without
           a dependecy on fish. (Closes: #453416)
    + [RA] Remove possible-non-posix-code-in-maintainer-script entirely.
      Debian Policy now allows local and test -a/-o specifically and this
      is pointless portability.
  * checks/standards-version:
    + [RA] 3.7.3 is now the current Standards-Version and anything older
      than 3.6.2 is ancient.

  * debian/control:
    + [TK] Add Vcs-* fields to point to Lintian's repository.
    + [RA] Update standards version to 3.7.3.
  * debian/dirs:
    + [RA] Stop creating empty /usr/share/lintian/{overrides,info}
      directories.  The latter is no longer used and the former is shipped
      with packages that include overrides.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Add critical as a recognized urgency.
    + [RA] Diagnose malformed override entries; don't just ignore them.
    + [RA] Fix some odd formatting.
    + [RA] Display a summary of overridden tags as an N: output line.
      Requested by Steve McIntyre.  (Closes: #452804)

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [RA] Be clearer about what files lintian takes as arguments; in
      particular, mention that source packages are checked by providing
      the .dsc file as an argument.  (Closes: #441636)
    + [RA] Fix a slight spacing problem with the --color flag.
    + [RA] Remove mention of unused /usr/share/lintian/info directory.

  * lib/DebVersions.pm:
    + [RA] Remove.  This isn't used by anything and would produce
      incorrect results (it doesn't understand ~), and Dep.pm provides
      version comparison routines that use dpkg.
  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [RA] Keep statistics on overrides by severity.

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Change the layout of the per-maintainer lintian pages.  Now,
      each report will be in /reports/maintainer/<email>.html where
      <email> is the maintainer's e-mail address with unsafe characters
      replaced by _.  This should allow better links from the QA pages.
      Thanks, Stefano Zacchiroli.

  * unpack/list-srcpkg:
    + [RA] Escape ; and newline characters in all package fields before
      writing them to the index (uncovered when someone accidentally
      appended a package description to Standards-Version).

lintian (1.23.36) unstable; urgency=low

  The "grand open change and desktop cleanup" release.

  * {checks,collection,depcheck,frontend,lib,reporting,unpack}/*:
    + [RA] Use the three-argument form of open uniformly, whether needed
      or not, to head off further quoting and whitespace interpretation
      bugs.
  
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Catch .DS_Store.gz files as well.
    + [RA] Warn about ._ Mac OS X resource files in the package.
    + [RA] Add a hopefully helpful note about how cruft from other
      operating systems can show up in binary packages.
  * checks/menu-format:
    + [RA] Fix detection of commands for menu entries when the command is
      given with its full path.  (Closes: #446796)
    + [RA] Remove Actions from known desktop keys again, as I believe the
      root problem was our willingness to inspect desktop types other than
      Application (also fixed in the previous release).
    + [RA] Fix Perl flow error when skipping some desktop files.
    + [RA] Skip unknown and deprecated key warnings and encoding key
      warnings in desktop files if they were of an unknown type.

  * lib/Dep.pm:
    + [RA] Fix negative implication in some boundary cases when comparing
      two versioned relationships in the same direction.  Thanks to
      Raphael Hertzog for the analysis and fix.  (Closes: #446768)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Oct 2007 21:23:16 -0700

lintian (1.23.35) unstable; urgency=low

  The "frantic bug catchup" release.

  * checks/changelog-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add some basic checks for NEWS.Debian files: naming,
      compression, encoding, a syntax check with Parse::DebianChangelog,
      and unreleased for the distribution.  (Closes: #437707)
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [RA] Allow Homepage in source and binary packages.
  * checks/control-file:
    + [RA] Support and ignore comments in debian/control.  Thanks, Julien
      Cristau.  (Closes: #440830)
    + [RA] Check for XS-Vcs-* headers and recommend (at info level) that
      they be changed to Vcs-* headers.  (Closes: #444661)
  * checks/cruft.desc:
    + [RA] Fix incorrect tag name for patch failure files.  Thanks, Romain
      Francoise.  (Closes: #437463)
  * checks/debconf:
    + [RA] A cdebconf that supported error was released with sarge, so
      don't require a versioned cdebconf dependency.  Thanks, Thijs
      Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #438860)
    + [RA] Various improvements from Thomas Huriaux: Diagnose select
      templates with only yes/no options, diagnose more question prompts,
      warn on any questions in the extended description, allow yes/no
      mentions in non-boolean templates, and catch more first-person
      language.  (Closes: #439508)
    + [RA] More exactly follow the Developer's Reference recommendations
      by only requiring open prompts for string and password prompts and
      only complaining about imperative wording for select and multiselect
      templates.  Thanks, Steve Langasek.  (Closes: #442711)
  * checks/description{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Warn (at info level for now) about Homepage pseudo-fields in
      the extended description.  (Closes: #444336)
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Allow python-all as yet another way of satisfying a Python
      build dependency.  (Closes: #444642)
  * checks/fields.desc:
    + [RA] Properly escape < and >.
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Warn about Thumbs.db files, which are usually useless Windows
      thumbnail databases.  Thanks, Paul Wise.  (Closes: #438202)
    + [RA] Warn about .DS_Store files, used by Mac OS X to store extended
      folder attributes.  Thanks, Paul Wise.  (Closes: #438203)
    + [RA] Improve the recommended command to remove .packlist files.
      Thanks, Justin Pryzby.
    + [RA] Don't think hard links are zero-length files.
    + [RA] Diagnose files with names ending in whitespace.
  * checks/infofiles:
    + [RA] Emacs 22 now allows embedded images in info files, so accept
      and ignore PNG files in the info directory.  More image types may be
      needed.  Thanks, Andreas Metzler.  (Closes: #438602)
  * checks/menu-format{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Reserved categories are okay in .desktop files if OnlyShowIn is
      present, and generally deserve their own separate tag regardless.
      Thanks, Michael Biebl.  (Closes: #442709)
    + [RA] Ignore categories beginning with "X-", reserved for category
      extensions.  Thanks, Josselin Mouette.  (Closes: #443827)
    + [RA] Allow Actions keys.  This isn't in the desktop standard but
      is widely used.  Thanks, Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #444651)
    + [RA] Ignore desktop files not for one of the known types.  This
      should significantly reduce the noise for KDE packages.
    + [RA] Only check whether a program referenced by Exec is in the
      package if the desktop file is in /usr/share/applications.  Too many
      applications use Exec for desktop files elsewhere without the
      standard PATH.
    + [RA] Ignore Exec fields pointing to kcmshell.
    + [RA] Ignore desktop files in /usr/share/doc or that appear to be
      templates.
    + [RA] Avoid uninitialized warnings on all-whitespace commands.
  * checks/menus:
    + [RA] Find the targets of hard links correctly.  (Closes: #444355)
    + [RA] Use the three-argument form of open to not fail on doc-base
      files ending in whitespace.  Error on doc-base files with Document
      fields that end in whitespace, since currently they break multiple
      tools.  Thanks, Ian Zimmerman.  (Closes: #444889)
  * checks/nmu.desc:
    + [RA] Remove obsolete note about binary NMUs.  Patch from Thijs
      Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #437925)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] We now have a csh package.  Allow it as an alternative for csh
      script dependencies.  Thanks, Bernd Zeimetz.  (Closes: #440825)
    + [RA] Allow install-sgmlcatalog --remove in postinst as well as
      prerm and suggest removing it entirely in the long description.
  * checks/version-substvars.desc:
    + [RA] Properly escape < and >.

  * collection/changelog-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Collect NEWS.Debian as well as changelog.

lintian (1.23.34) unstable; urgency=low

  The "brown paper operator" release.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Use =~ with regexes, not eq.  Thanks, Guillem Jover.
      (Closes: #436180)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 05 Aug 2007 19:58:38 -0700

lintian (1.23.33) unstable; urgency=low

  The "menu and cruft reorganization" release.
  
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [CW] Add automaken as a known virtual package.
    + [CW] Update architectures to dpkg 1.14.5, adding solaris-* and lpia.
    + [RA] Add %known_obsolete_emacs.
  * checks/cruft{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for .git directories in source packages.  Thanks, Julien
      Cristau.  (Closes: #433516)
    + [RA] Substantially rewrite how all cruft checking against source
      packages is done, incorporating debdiff in the process.  There are
      now two tags for most source package cruft problems: one for files
      introduced in the Debian diff or in a native package, and one for
      files present upstream.  The former is at warning severity and the
      latter is at info severity, since it's usually not worth repackaging
      the upstream source to remove such files.  In the process,
      standardize the names of all of the tags and pull the regexes out
      into data instead of code for easier maintenance.  (Closes: #434744)
  * checks/debdiff{.desc}:
    + [RA] Removed, incorporated into checks/cruft.
  * checks/debian-readme:
    + [RA] Replace all uses of tag_error and tag_warn with just tag.
  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Tag packages listing emacs21 as the preferred Emacs flavor in a
      dependency.  Thanks, Tatsuya Kinoshita.  (Closes: #434978)
    + [RA] Start tagging unversioned dependencies on coreutils again since
      the transition from fileutils is long-since finished.  Thanks,
      Guillem Jover.  (Closes: #436058)
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for .git directories in binary packages.
  * checks/menu-format{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Switch to the new menu hierarchy, which will be in the next
      release of Policy.  Add specific checks for the major renamings to
      hopefully cut down on the confusion and provide some specific
      guidance.  Remove the code that allowed for applications to create
      new sub-menus, since the current menu documentation says not to do
      that.  (Closes: #431844)
    + [RA] Add checks of desktop files.  The checks so far are basic, but
      do include key and category verification.  Based heavily on work by
      Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña.  (Closes: #277441, #433411)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] If rm output is redirected to /dev/null, don't think that rm is
      removing /dev/null.  Thanks, Robert Luberda.  (Closes: #431259)
    + [RA] xjed also provides jed-script.  Thanks, Jörg Sommer.
      (Closes: #431629)
    + [RA] Don't complain about ruby libraries in /usr/lib/ruby that have
      shebang lines.  This is a common means for embedding unit tests in
      Ruby libraries.  Thanks, Paul van Tilburg.  (Closes: #431545)
    + [RA] Don't push depending directly on update-inetd in the long
      description of maintainer-script-needs-depends-on-update-inetd.
      Most packages should depend on inet-superserver.  Leave the check
      the same for the time being, however.
    + [RA] Replace all uses of tag_error and tag_warn with just tag.
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [RA] Exclude udebs from dependency checking in the shlibs files
      since binary packages may legitimately declare udeb dependencies on
      other packages.  Thanks, Loïc Minier.  (Closes: #431395)
  * checks/spelling:
    + [RA] Replace all uses of tag_error and tag_warn with just tag.
  * checks/version-substvars:
    + [RA] Don't skip other checks for binNMUability when warning about
      the deprecated ${Source-Version} substvar.  Thanks, Lior Kaplan.
      (Closes: #432959)

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Add \w+-backports to the known distribution list.  Thanks,
      Vincent Danjean.  (Closes: #432268)

  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [RA] Replace any newlines in the extra information to the tag
      function with \n.

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [RA] Remove the mention of the debdiff check script.

lintian (1.23.32) unstable; urgency=low

  The "stability of output" release.

  * checks/binaries:
    + [RA] Sort the package SONAMEs to provide more stable lintian tags.
      Patch from Cyril Brulebois.  (Closes: #428681)
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Limit the Zope license exception to only .dtml, .pt, and .cpt
      files.  Thanks, Bernd Zeimetz.
    + [RA] Sort the files listed in package-contains-hardlink so that the
      lintian output is stable regardless of the hash order of the
      directory when the tar file was built.
    + [RA] Don't incorrectly skip all other file location checks for hard
      links.
    + [RA] Check for files installed in /usr/lib/sgml.  This transition
      was probably completed long ago, but checking for regression can't
      hurt.  (Closes: #90019)
  * checks/manpages{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for dh_make man page templates (by looking for the
      template whatis entry).  Thanks, Bill Allombert.  (Closes: #173583)
  * checks/menus:
    + [RA] Avoid a quadratic search of the files in the package on
      doc-base files that list tons of files individually.  This speeds up
      a lintian check of openoffice.org-dev-doc enormously.
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [RA] Close the template file handle between files so that the line
      numbers for translated default fields are correct.
  * checks/rules{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for ignoring all errors from make clean or make distclean
      and recommend skipping the call if there's no Makefile instead.
      Thanks, Branden Robinson.  (Closes: #325372)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add Octave as an interpreter, and allow both versioned and
      unversioned forms.  Thanks, Sebastian Harl.  (Closes: #428403)
    + [RA] Check for deprecated install-sgmlcatalog usage.
  * checks/shared_libs:
    + [RA] Report the correct file for shlib-with-nonpic-code rather than
      the last shlib in the package.  (Closes: #429840, #429528)

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [RA] Don't require -v in order to report unused overrides; they're
      already info-level tags, which is enough hiding.
    + [RA] Remove old dead unused override code.

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Fix a Perl warning when generating the clean maintainer pages.

  * unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1:
    + [RA] Sort the output of tar tfv by filename so that the lintian
      output will be stable regardless of the hash order of the directory
      when the tar file was built.

    + [RA] Update architectures to dpkg 1.14.1.  Remove all linux-*
      architectures and add armel.  (Closes: #421995)
  * checks/control-files.desc:
    + [RA] Change unknown-control-file to a warning, since Policy only
      discourages it and doesn't outlaw it.  (Closes: #287209)
  * checks/cruft:
    + [RA] Allow any automake package to satisfy the autotools-dev build
      dependency for suppressing warnings about out of date autotools
      helper files.  (Closes: #417067)
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Require libmodule-build-perl in Build-Depends if the clean rule
      runs perl Build.  Hopefully this isn't too aggressive.  Thanks, Ian
      Beckwith.  (Closes: #421549)
  * checks/files:
    + [RA] Don't warn about LICENSE files in Zope products, since they may
      be used for runtime display.  (Closes: #424164)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [RA] Avoid false positives on binaries with X11 in the name.  Patch
      from Kevin B. McCarty.  (Closes: #423229)

      manual reference.  (Closes: #423519)
  * checks/menus:
    + [RA] Allow multiple blank lines between doc-base sections and

      Reported by Luis Rodrigo Gallardo Cruz.  (Closes: #423096)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [RA] Add pagsh, provided by openafs-client and heimdal-clients.
    + [RA] Diagnose removal of device files in maintainer scripts per
      Policy 10.6.  (Closes: #268688)
    + [RA] Add jruby1.0.  Thanks, Sebastien Delafond.  (Closes: #426950)
    + [RA] Add jed and friends.  Thanks, Jörg Sommer.  (Closes: #426469)
    + [RA] Move several maintainer script checks specific to shell scripts
      inside the conditional so that they won't run on maintainer scripts
      not written in shell.
    + [RA] Diagnose maintainer scripts looking at /var/lib/dpkg/status
      directly.  Thanks, Guillem Jover.  (Closes: #426628)
    + [RA] Diagnose direct modifications to /etc/services, /etc/protocols,

lintian (1.23.30) unstable; urgency=low

  The "beating false positives off with a stick" release.

  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [RA] Add mktemp and sysvinit-utils as known essential packages.
    + [RA] Add Vcs-Mtn and Vcs-Browser to the known source package
      fields.
    + [RA] Add Kernel-Version to known udeb control fields.
  * checks/control-files:
    + [RA] Allow clilibs, but don't try to check the syntax of it yet.
      Thanks, Sebastian Dröge.  (Closes: #378088)
  * checks/copyright-file:
    + [RA] Exclude the Affero General Public License from the check for
      references to the shared GPL copy.  (Closes: #420077)
    + [RA] Replace yet another hand-rolled dependency parser with Dep.
  * checks/cruft{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for svk commit message files.
  * checks/debconf{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Remove the dependency check for SETTITLE since all debconf
      implementations back to oldstable support it.
    + [RA] Reduce the dependency check for error templates to info since
      all debconf implementations back to stable support it.
  * checks/debhelper{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Downgrade the dependency check for dh_python and the Python
      policy to info since all debhelpers back to stable support it.
    + [RA] Downgrade the dependency check for compatibility level V5 to
      info since all debhelpers back to stable support it.
  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] The CDBS Python rules only call pycentral or pysupport during
      the binary targets, so those dependencies can be safely moved to
      Build-Depends-Indep.  Still allow them in Build-Depends, though,
      since that's where CDBS likes to put them.  Thanks, Tristan
      Seligmann.  (Closes: #420526)
    + [RA] Allow the Python core packages themselves to depend on
      python-minimal.
    + [RA] Remove the version constraints for python-central and
      python-support dependencies since stable released with a working
      version and they weren't in oldstable.
    + [RA] Remove the dependency check on dh_installxfonts for the X.Org
      transition since the debhelper released with stable does the right
      thing and this dependency is not useful for backports to oldstable.
    + [RA] Remove the version on the quilt dependency check.  It's not
      worth the effort to maintain a separate version check for oldstable
      backports.  (Closes: #420160)
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for svk commit message files.
    + [RA] Don't consider {copying,license}.dtd extra license files; the
      Mozilla suite uses them for non-licenses.  (Closes: #420558)
    + [RA] Use $pkg rather than reading fields/package for the x11-common
      pre-depend check.
    + [RA] Allow x11-common to install /usr/X11R6/bin.
    + [RA] Downgrade the pre-depends on x11-common requirement for
      packages installing into /usr/include/X11 or /usr/lib/X11 to info
      since it's only needed for upgrades from sarge or early etch.
  * checks/md5sums:
    + [RA] Don't warn about a missing md5sums file if the package contains
      nothing for which we would generate an MD5 checksum.  Thanks,
      Andreas Beckmann.  (Closes: #420465)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [RA] Cope with more uses of - in *roff escapes that don't need
      hyphen warnings.
    + [RA] Don't consider a binary an X binary if it's a symlink into
      /etc/X11.  (seyon does something weird but probably legitimate.)
    + [RA] Fix manpage-for-non-x11-binary-in-wrong-directory and
      manpage-for-x11-binary-in-wrong-directory output.  (Closes: #295072)
  * checks/menus{.desc,}:
    + [RA] In doc-base control files, check for Index fields for HTML and
      Info documents and require that each section after the header have a
      Format field.  Thanks, Bernhard R. Link.  (Closes: #419847)
  * checks/rules:
    + [RA] Listing a rule as a dependency of .PHONY is sufficient to mark
      it as present for GNU make and hence sufficient for Policy's
      requirement.  Thanks, Peter Eisentraut.  (Closes: #419446)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Packages calling update-xmlcatalog must depend on xml-core.
      Also avoid false positives when a package itself provides the
      program its maintainer scripts use.  Thanks, Daniel Leidert.
      (Closes: #419461)
    + [RA] Check for maintainer scripts calling read (but exclude those
      that include /usr/share/debconf/confmodule on the grounds that
      they're probably only using it as a fallback).  Based on a patch by
      Luk Claes.  (Closes: #231770)
    + [RA] Add pike7.6 and ruby1.9 as valid interpreters.
    + [RA] Diagnose use of /bin/env with a more specific message than the
      generic unusual interpreter tag.
    + [RA] Remove the version constraint on the gconf-schemas check since
      all versions of gconf2 back to stable provide this script and it's
      not worth maintaining a separate check for oldstable backports.
  * checks/shared-libs{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Warn if a package declares dependencies in its shlibs control
      file that cannot be satisfied by that package (including via
      Provides).  (Closes: #56440)

  * reporting/harness:
    + [RA] Include overridden tags in the lintian output so that we can do
      statistical reporting on them and see them in lintian.log.
  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [RA] Create stub pages for maintainers with only lintian-clean
      packages.  (Closes: #305173)
    + [RA] Sort packages on each maintainer's page.
    + [RA] Report statistics on info tags as well.
    + [RA] Generate better file names for maintainer pages with weird
      characters.
    + [RA] Fix Perl warnings.

lintian (1.23.29) unstable; urgency=low

  The "look at all the stuff that accumulated during the etch freeze"
  release.

  * COPYING:
    + [CW] Update to current text of GPL v2 (which talks about the GNU
      Lesser General Public License rather than Library, etc.; no functional
      changes).

  * checks/changelog-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for bug closers without a colon after closes, but only if
      there are at least six digits in the bug number and no non-digits.
      Suggestion from Jari Aalto.  (Closes: #373918)
  * checks/copyright-file{.desc,}:
    + [JA] Update usr-doc-* test to report user-share-doc-* instead.
      New tests added: postinst-should-not-set-usr-doc-link,
      doc-base-file-references-usr-doc.
      Patch from Thijs Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #406349).
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [JA] Perl syntax corrections.
    + [JA] Support the Autobuild: and Vcs-* fields in .dsc files.
      Applied patch to implement this by Ian Beckwith.  (Closes: #403553).
  * checks/control-file:
    + [RA] Allow source in main to generate contrib packages.  Thanks,
      Bdale Garbee.  (Closes: #401881)
  * checks/cruft{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Use Dep to check autotools-dev build dependency rather than
      rolling our own dependency parsing, thus avoiding problems when it's
      the first dependency.  Thanks, Tilman Koschnick.  (Closes: #412406)
    + [RA] Mention that including CVS or .svn directories in a release
      tarball should generally be reported as an upstream bug.  Qualify
      the statement that export should be used instead of checkout to
      refer to snapshot packaging.  Thanks, Jari Aalto.  (Closes: #373668)
    + [RA] Allow a build dependency on automake to satisfy the
      autotools-dev requirement since users may use autoreconf to update
      config.{sub,guess}.  Thanks, Jordà Polo.  (Closes: #417067)
  * checks/debconf:
    + [RA] Rather than munging dependencies to cope with the various
      implementations of debconf, take advantage of our new dependency
      comparison routines and check the full correct dependency.  This
      should really fix problems with checking the dependencies for
      settitle.  Patch from Damyan Ivanov.  (Closes: #349616)
    + [RA] Check that an appropriate versioned dependency on debconf
      and/or cdebconf is present if error template types are used.
      Thanks, Christian Perrier.  (Closes: #416140)
  * checks/debhelper.desc:
    + [RA] Use consistent file naming when diagnosing possibly conflicting
      debhelper compat settings.  Thanks, Jari Aalto.  (Closes: #409122)
  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add an exception to maintainer-not-full-name for Wookey and a
      comment to consider removing the check if we get more false
      positives.  Thanks, Neil Williams.  (Closes: #406731)
    + [RA] Rename build-depends-indep-should-be-build-depends to
      clean-should-be-satisfied-by-build-depends to make the reason for
      the message clearer without running lintian -i.  Thanks to Osamu
      Aoki for the suggestion.  (Closes: #405840)
    + [RA] Recognize the +bX convention for binary NMUs.  Warn about use
      of the old three-part version numbers.
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Diagnose creation of subdirectories of /usr/bin other than mh
      and the legacy X11 directory.  (Closes: #417912)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [RA] When checking for hyphen used as a minus sign, avoid false
      positives on \s-1 (small font) and \*(-- (pod2man long dash).
    + [RA] Display the full path for binary-without-manpage tags to make
      it easier to track down problems.
    + [RA] Ignore binaries in subdirectories of the normal binary
      directories (other than /usr/bin/X11 and /usr/bin/mh).  These should
      be caught by other checks and the man page warnings would likely be
      confusing noise.
  * checks/menu-format{.desc,}:
    + [RA] If a menu icon isn't an absolute path, only look for it in
      /usr/share/pixmaps, not in the old X11R6 paths.  Update the long tag
      description accordingly.
  * checks/menus:
    + [JA] Perl syntax corrections.  Removed extra empty newlines.
  * checks/lintian.desc:
    + [RA] List emergency as a valid urgency.
  * checks/nmu{.desc,}:
    + [RA] List the exact phrases recognized by lintian as marking an NMU.
      Reported by Jari Aalto.  (Closes: #409108)
    + [RA] Recognize the +bX convention for binary NMUs.
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [RA] Now that we're passing --use-untranslated to msgcmp, we have to
      compare the generated pot file with the one in the package both
      directions to catch all out of date errors.  Thanks, Thomas
      Huriaux.  (Closes: #402662)
  * checks/rules{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Fix the policy section for debian-rules-missing-required-target
      and debian-rules-not-a-makefile.  Thanks, Daniel Kahn Gillmor.
      (Closes: #414964)
    + [RA] Warn about use of $(PWD) instead of $(CURDIR).
    + [RA] Setting DH_COMPAT globally in debian/rules is now deprecated in
      favor of debian/compat.  Patch from Luk Claes.  (Closes: #330025)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] update-inetd is now its own package and netbase may not always
      depend on it.  Update the check to require a dependency on
      update-inetd, inet-superserver, or one of the inet-superserver
      packages that provides update-inetd.  Reported by Tatsuya Kinoshita.
      (Closes: #402319)
    + [RA] Mention SUSv3 in the bashism and non-posix tag descriptions,
      note that use of test -a/-o and local aren't bugs but may still be
      worth avoiding, and mention short circuiting of && and ||.  (Thanks
      to Jari Aalto for the latter).
    + [RA] Add /usr/bin/gbr2, provided by gambas2-runtime.  Thanks, José
      "L. Redrejo" Rodríguez.  (Closes: #403515)
    + [RA] Add /usr/bin/jruby0.9, provided by jruby0.9.  Thanks, Sebastien
      Delafond.  (Closes: #418105)

  * doc/README:
    + Document --color option.  Based on a patch from Loïc Minier.

  * depcheck/deppages.pl:
    + [JA] Perl syntax corrections.
  * depcheck/report2html.pl:
    + [JA] Perl syntax corrections.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [JA] Removed trailing spaces and other perl syntax corrections.
    + [RA] Add --color option to optionally colorize lintian tags based on
      their severity.  Based on a patch from Loïc Minier.
    + [RA] Accept emergency as a valid urgency and check urgencies
      case-insensitively since that's what Policy specifies.  Thanks, Joey
      Hess.  (Closes: #412577)
  * frontend/lintian-info:
    + [RA] Ignore ANSI color sequences when parsing lintian tags.

  * lib/Checker.pm
    + [JA] Perl syntax corrections.
  * lib/Lab.pm
    + [JA] Perl syntax corrections.
  * lib/Tags.pm

      Based on a patch from Loïc Minier.  (Closes: #399714)

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [RA] Document --color.  Based on a patch from Loïc Minier.

lintian (1.23.27) unstable; urgency=low

  The "we haven't run this against the whole archive in a while" release

  * checks/binaries{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Tag unrecognized ELF binaries as apparently corrupted rather
      than failing with a note that binutils-multiarch is required.  Some
      packages have had ELF binaries recognized by file but unreadable.
      Reported by Bill Allombert.  (Closes: #399456)
  * checks/infofiles:
    + [RA] Don't consider /usr/share/infon to be an info directory.
      Reported by Joachim Breitner.  (Closes: #399857)
  * checks/md5sums:
    + [RA] Also don't complain about missing md5sums for files in
      /var/lib/ispell as they're changed after installation.  Thanks,
      Agustin Martin.  (Closes: #401070)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [RA] gettext 0.16's msgcmp requires --use-untranslated when checking
      for newer templates than PO files or it gives false positives for
      every package.  Thanks, Damyan Ivanov.  (Closes: #400957)
    + [RA] Don't consider directories to be stray template files even if
      named template.  Thanks, Thomas Huriaux.  (Closes: #401442)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [RA] Don't report shlib-with-non-pic-code unless we're sure that
      we're looking at a shared library.  Otherwise, we get many false
      positives on some platforms where text relocations are normal for
      binaries.  Reported by Bill Allombert.  (Closes: #399525)

  * collection/file-info:
    + [RA] Unescape non-ASCII characters escaped by tar before running
      file on the resulting filename.  Otherwise, file can't find the
      file, exits with an error, and lintian aborts.  Reported by Bill
      Allombert.  (Closes: #399392)
  * collection/objdump-info:
    + [RA] Include unrecognized format errors from objdump in the output
      rather than aborting; some packages contain apparently corrupt ELF
      binaries.

  * debian/control:
    + [RA] Depend on gettext 0.16 or later for --use-untranslated.

  * lib/Lab.pm:
    + [RA] Preserve the old package lists when setting up a static lab so
      that the unpack programs can build a list of changed packages and
      incremental mode works.  Thanks, Bill Allmobert.  (Closes: #400342)

  * unpack/list-udebpkg:
    + [RA] Handle compressed udeb Packages files.  Thanks, Bill
      Allombert.  (Closes: #400338)

lintian (1.23.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * checks/binaries{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add a policy reference for unstripped-binary-or-object.
      Thanks, Bas Wijnen.  (Closes: #394419)
    + [RA] Add a special exception to the shared library dependency check
      for the dynamic loader itself.
  * checks/changelog-file.desc:
    + [RA] Downgrade to a warning several errors with changelog files,
      including compression and a text version of HTML changelogs, that
      are only shoulds in Policy.  (Closes: #289723)
    + [RA] Cleaned up language and use of unbalanced single quotes in
      numerous descriptions.
  * checks/control-file{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Diagnose a control file that creates binary packages in a
      different archive category from the source package or the other
      binary packages.  Idea from Yann Dirson.  (Closes: #394720)
    + [RA] Close opened files.
    + [RA] Add info-level check for Section in the source section of the
      control file.  (Closes: #322244)
  * checks/cruft{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Tighten the timestamp check on config.{sub,guess} to look for
      files dated 2004 or newer, since that's when x86_64 was added.
      Increase to an error at the request of Ryan Murray since we already
      suppress this warning of config.{guess,sub} are modified by the
      Debian patch or if the package build-depends on autotools-dev.
      (Closes: #190897)
  * checks/debconf{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Take into account comma escaping when checking the number of
      translated choices.  Reported by Frans Pop.  (Closes: #395028)
    + [RA] Only require debconf be loaded in the postinst script if a
      config script exists.  Reported by Josselin Mouette.
    + [RA] Require pre-depends on debconf if debconf is used in the
      preinst script.  Update the long description to deprecate only
      depending on debconf and falling back on another configuration
      system.  Reported by Josselin Mouette.  (Closes: #395468)
    + [RA] Warn of debconf notes displayed with low or medium priority,
      with an exception for Policy-required device file warnings.  Based
      on a patch by Thomas Huriaux.  (Closes: #389070)
    + [RA] Close files after opening them, fixing incorrect line numbers
      when reporting problems with config scripts.
  * checks/debdiff{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for creation of ~ and .xxx.swp backup files in the Debian
      diff, but only at the info level for now since they cause no harm.
      (Closes: #332770)
  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Clarify in missing-build-dependency why lintian does not take
      into account transitive build dependencies.  (Closes: #393975)
    + [RA] Avoid Perl warning when diagnosing a Python-Version of the form
      "all, >= 2.4".  Thanks, Thijs Kinkhorst.  (Closes: #394104)
    + [RA] Teach the debian/rules parsing about make conditionals and
      don't require build dependencies for lines encountered inside a
      conditional (in other words, assume people using conditionals know
      what they're doing).  Fixes a false positive due to the unusual
      arch-specific build dependencies for openoffice.org, reported by
      Rene Engelhard.  (Closes: #380286)
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for vim .swp files in the package.
    + [RA] Split the warning for NFS temporary files into a separate tag
      from the warning for editor backup files.
  * checks/infofiles:
    + [RA] Close opened files.
    + [RA] debhelper no longer adds a --section flag to install-info, so
      don't warn about any install-info invocation without --section.
      Instead, check each info file for INFO-DIR-SECTION and diagnose
      calling install-info without --section if any info file is missing
      this information.  (Closes: #97502, #398670)
    + [RA] Checks for the compression and suffixes of info files were not
      being run due to a mistake in specifying either /usr/info or
      /usr/share/info as an info directory.  Re-enable them.
  * checks/md5sums{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Add a tag for a missing md5sums control file, but only at info
      level, at least for now.  (Closes: #133027)
    + [RA] Do better syntax checking of the md5sums control file and
      report malformed lines as a tag rather than aborting lintian.
    + [RA] Downgrade file-missing-in-md5sums to a warning since it doesn't
      break the package or debsums and may be intentional.
  * checks/menu.desc:
    + [RA] Remove stray commas in Ref strings since the reporting code
      considers commas to be separating two different references.
  * checks/menu-format{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Support the sux, gksu, and kdesu wrappers in menu commands as
      well as su-to-root.  (Closes: #360227)
    + [RA] Fix tag name for menu-icon-cannot-be-parsed.  Thanks, Bill
      Allombert.  (Closes: #399245)
  * checks/po-debconf{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Check for misnamed PO files in debian/po, which cause
      translations to be merged into the template with the wrong names and
      not found.  Based on a patch by Thomas Huriaux.  (Closes: #387360)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [RA] Calling ldconfig is also required for libraries installed in
      various subdirectories of its standard search path based on hardware
      capabilities.  Reported by Aurelien Jarno.  (Closes: #396278)

  * debian/rules:

      any warnings were found.  Thanks, Daniel Bonniot.  (Closes: #189656)

  * man/lintian.1:

  The "dependency and debconf" release

  * checks/debconf:
    + [CW] Don't trigger partially-translated-question when Choices-C exists
      but not Description-C.
    + [RA] Remove select-with-translated-default-field since there are
      cases where this is correct and we can perform a better check
      against the source package.  Patch from Thomas Huriaux.
    + [RA] Fix Perl warnings when a template has no type.
  * checks/debdiff:
    + [RA] Remove the source-tar-is-posix-tar tag.  This was only a

    + [RA] Improve the long descriptions of the warnings about dependencies
      on essential or build-essential packages to make it clearer that the
      correct resolution is normally to omit the dependency and why.

    + [RA] aspell dictionary packages may ship files in /var/lib/aspell

      interpreters.  Thanks, Tatsuya Kinoshita.  (Closes: #386798)
    + [RA] Add a separate tag for tclsh dependencies to explain about the
      virtual package and improve the description of the wish virtual
      package in its tag.  Fix inverted logic that got the wish dependency
      backwards.  Reported by Hamish Moffatt.  (Closes: #387845)
    + [RA] Allow tcsh to satisfy a csh dependency.  Reported by Yann
      Dirson.  (Closes: #389615)

      wrappers around scripts written in another language.

      aa|bb implies aa|bb|cc.  Fix the comparison of dependencies for
      inverse implication to catch many more cases.  (The latter code
      isn't currently used in lintian.)
    + [RA] Add an unparse function to take an internal representation and
      convert it back to human-readable text.
    + [RA] Significantly improve and rewrite the get_dups function to only
      find relations that imply each other and to return the complete
      duplicate dependencies in sets.

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [RA] Document setting TMPDIR to change the location of lintian's
      temporary lab.  (Closes: #388786)

    + [RA] Check for missing build dependencies on python-central or
      python-support.  Thanks, Raphaël Hertzog.
    + [RA] Check for old << dependencies on Python in Python packages that
      lack a Python-Version control field, as these are probably packages
      that don't follow the new Python policy.  Thanks, Raphaël Hertzog.
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Provide a better explanation of why Debian packages shouldn't
      ship files in /srv.  (Closes: #379176)
    + [RA] Warn about files installed into /etc/gconf/schemas.

      maintainer scripts written in Perl.
    + [RA] Mention [[ ]] explicitly in the possible-bashism long
      description as requiring a Korn shell and make it clearer that the
      primary arbiter of this test is the POSIX shell specification.
      (Closes: #381800 by clarification)

      substvar for a versioned dependency on a package not built from the
      same source.  (Closes: #377141, #376596)

  * collection/changelog-file:
    + [RA] Be much more careful about changelog files that are symlinks.
      Don't skip over changelog symlinks just because they point to
      non-existant files, mark unsafe symlinks or symlinks to non-existent
      files by creating copyright as a symlink to a non-existent file in
      the lab, and don't create an empty dummy changelog if we couldn't
      find a changelog.  Correctly handle changelog files that are
      symlinks to other files in the same directory.

  * debian/copyright:

      the description.  (Closes: #376109)

  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [RA] If a tag has been overriden via any mechanism, do not add it to
      any of the statistics (tag, severity, or significance).  Before, the
      override only suppressed a record for the specific statistic the
      override was based on, meaning that classic tag-based overrides
      didn't suppress severity statistics.  Overridden error tags would
      therefore cause lintian to exit with non-zero status.  Thanks,
      Andree Leidenfrost and Martin F. Krafft.  (Closes: #377182, #374314)

      templates.  (Closes: #368206)
  * checks/common_data.pm:

  * checks/debhelper:
    + [RA] Use the Dep library to check debhelper build dependencies

  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Allow build-depend on quilt if clean depends on the xsfclean
      rule, for packages maintained by the X Strike Force.
    + [RA] CDBS packages that use the python-distutils class should list
      Python in Build-Depends, not Build-Depends-Indep, since CDBS wants
      to use it in debian/rules clean.  Thanks, Jan Lübbe.
    + [HE] Add check for build-deps on build-essential. Yes, people do that.

      Build-Depends on quilt in that case.  Reported by Sam Hocevar.
      (Closes: #374878)
    + [RA] Fix handling of versioned Build-Depends to avoid spurious
      build-depends-without-arch-dep warnings.  Reported by Marcus
      Better.
    + [RA] Don't require Build-Depends on perl even if run explicitly in
      debian/rules clean, since perl-base may be sufficient.  Catch more
      ways perl could be run, including the common idiom for packages that
      use Build.PL.
    + [RA] Downgrade build-depends-without-arch-dep to info from warning.
      Policy doesn't require using Build-Depends-Indep for
      arch-independent packages and the test has a lot of false positives.
    + [RA] Require ant in Build-Depends when using the CDBS ant rule.
    + [RA] Bypass the build-depends-without-arch-dep check entirely when
      using ant, since determining which Java dependencies are then
      permissible in Build-Depends is too complex to do a proper job.
      Reported by Peter Eisentraut.  (Closes: #372190)
    + [RA] Only allow patch in Build-Depends for yada unpatch, don't

  * checks/po-debconf{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Exempt packages that use yada from the POTFILES.in check and

      compatibility versions, mention that debhelper defaults to version 1
      if not set anywhere.  (Closes: #360711)
    + [RA] Move simple man page references from Info into Ref.
  * checks/fields{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Allow dpatch in Build-Depends for arch-independent packages if
      it is invoked in clean, build-arch, or binary-arch.
    + [RA] Only list examples of non-standard architectures, since there
      are now too many combinations to list completely.
    + [RA] Catch dependencies on X metapackages, based on a patch by Josh
      Triplett.  No packages are allowed to build-depend, and only
      packages that look like metapackages (arch: all, no files outside of
      /usr/share/doc) are allowed to depend.  (Closes: #347169)
    + [RA] Look for an explicit section of unknown, probably left over
      from dh_make templates, and diagnose it with an error rather than a
      warning.  Reported by Jari Aalto.  (Closes: #355032)
    + [RA] Reorganize dependency checking based on debian/rules analysis.
      Diagnose missing build dependencies on the helper packages we know
      about, catch cases where Build-Depends-Indep should be Build-Depends
      because of the clean target, and make sure users of dh_python
      build-depend on python.  yada is no longer a special case.
      (Closes: #242789, #278290)
    + [RA] Check for conflicting with dependencies and build-conflicting
      with build dependencies.  (Closes: #122760)
    + [RA] Allow xfonts-utils in dependencies.  It's not actually an X
      font package.
  * checks/files{.desc,}:
    + [RA] For the X.Org 7 transition, add explicit checks for fonts and
      binaries installed in /usr/X11R6.  Rename the existing check for
      other files in /usr/X11R6 since the tag had a pluralization error
      and we want package maintainers to see the error again and
      reconsider whether to ignore it.  No packages should be installing
      files in /usr/X11R6 going forward.  Remove the policy cross-refs for
      right now until policy catches up.
  * checks/manpages:
    + [RA] Use system_env instead of system and sanitize the environment
      before running man -l out of caution and to avoid extraneous output
      when CDPATH is set.  Reported by Marc Haber.  (Closes: #360217)
  * checks/nmu{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Warn if debian/changelog in a native source package is a
      symlink and skip checks rather than aborting if it was a symlink to
      a file we didn't unpack.  (Closes: #257650)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [RA] Use system_env instead of system out of caution and to avoid
      extraneous output when CDPATH is set.
  * checks/rules{.desc,}:
    + [RA] A new set of checks that parses debian/rules and checks for
      required rules, debian/rules as a symlink, and the correct first
      line.  Based heavily on previous work by René van Bevern.
      (Closes: #294926, #311786)
  * checks/scripts{.desc,}:
    + [RA] Ignore text inside single quotes and, for most checks, text
      inside double quotes when checking for bashisms.  Reported by Frank
      Küster.  (Closes: #344266)
    + [RA] Change canonical zsh path to /bin/zsh at the request of the zsh
      maintainer.  (Closes: #360534)
    + [RA] Change the check for broken error handling with invoke-rc.d to
      maintainer-script-hides-init-failure to be more generic and explain
      what the test looks at.  Add the script name and line number and fix
      a typo.  Thanks, Marc Haber.  (Closes: #360214, #360216)
    + [RA] Warn when maintainer scripts run init scripts directly and
      don't use invoke-rc.d.  Thanks, Lars Wirzenius.  (Closes: #353659)
    + [RA] Find missing ucf dependencies and restructure the code to allow
      easier addition of similar checks.  (Closes: #261891)
    + [RA] Add python2.5, lua50, gbx, and gbx2 to the list of valid
      interpreters.  (Closes: #361601, #361644, #362566)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [RA] Limit shlib-without-PT_GNU_STACK-section to only those
      architectures where gcc always adds the section.  Thanks to Frans
      Pop for the report and Bastian Blank for the architecture list.
      (Closes: #357636)

  * collection/objdump-info:
    + [RA] Unset CDPATH before running cd to avoid strange effects from
      the user's environment.
    + [RA] Run readelf -l to collect interpreter information.

  * lib/Dep.pm:
    + [RA] Add initial support for analyzing architecture information in
      dependencies instead of ignoring it.
  * lib/Read_taginfo.pm:
    + [RA] Add support for formatting man page references from Ref.

  * checks/debhelper:
    + [RA] Recognize setting DH_COMPAT with := in addition to = in
      debian/rules.  (Closes: #349272)
    + [RA] CDBS sets DH_COMPAT to 4 but doesn't export it.  It does create
      debian/compat with that value if none was present.  Reflect this
      behavior to avoid spurious compat level warnings when using CDBS.
      Based on a patch by Jay Berkenbilt.  (Closes: #350228)
  * checks/fields:
    + [RA] Allow a quilt build-dependency for arch-independent packages if
      the quilt makefile rules are included.  (Closes: #349273)
    + [RA] If clean depends on a rule that calls dh_clean rather than
      calling it directly, still allow debhelper in Build-Depends for
      arch-independent packages.  Reported by Michael Stilkerich.
    + [JvW] Commented that Uploaders no longer will hit the multiline field
      issue, updated testsuite accordingly

      so that .so inclusions are processed correctly.  Based on a patch by

  * checks/menu-format:
    + [RA] Look for binaries in /usr/X11R6/bin, not /usr/bin/X11, per

      clearly distinguish from the Debian Menu Policy.  (Closes: #347510)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [RA] If there are template files in debian, assume the package uses

      Thomas Huriaux.  (Closes: #353294)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [RA] Allow /tmp in variable settings.  It's likely to be a false

      filenames containing shell metacharacters.  Reported by Michael

      James R. Van Zandt.  (Closes: #351324)
    + [RA] Allow more variations on leading magic to invoke some
      interpreter rather than then shell.  Bypass the ELF magic check for
      scripts using magic that relies on having no leading #! line.
      Reported by Frank Küster.  (Closes: #344269)
    + [JvW] Add check against package suffering from debhelper bug #337664,
      per Joey Hess, which had broken error detection (Closes: #358523)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [JvW] Fix postinst-must-call-ldconfig to also get emitted when there is
      no postinst at all, instead of just one lacking a ldconfig call
    + [JvW] Implement checks for "udeb:" lines in shlibs files
      (Closes: #357541)
    + [JvW] Consider also the soname version for shlibs checking, preventing
      some bogus 'duplicate' warnings, and actually throw a warning when
      soname version doesn't match
    + [JvW] Added error when udeb postinst calls ldconfig, that must never
      happen (thanks to Frans Pop for noticing, see #203056)

  * debian/{control,copyright}:
    + [RA] Add Russ Allbery to Uploaders and copyright.
    + [JvW] Version dpkg-dev requirement to >= 1.13.17, for

      of _valid_version for definedness and not the boolean value
      (Closes: #345005)
    + [FL] Better check for false postives of build-depends-without-arch-dep.
      Should fix false positives for cdbs, dbs, dpatch and yada. Based on
      a patch by Russ Allbery (Closes: #344609, #321135, #339750)

  * checks/init.d:

    + [FL] fix typo in description of package-name-doesnt-match-sonames

    + [FL] The Debian specific patches from coreutils to call strip with
      --remove-section arguments on install -s have been dropped. Adapt
      description of binary-has-unneeded-section accordingly and demote
      it to "info" because many packages will get this now.
  * checks/debconf{.desc,}:
    + [FL] drop seen-flag-requires-versioned-depends and
      multiselect-without-dependency and drop version requirement from
      missing-debconf-dependency-for-preinst. All due to the fact that
      woody shipped with 1.0.x and therefor versioned depends on versions
      lesser than that don't make much sense anymore (Closes: #333736)

    + [FL] Merge most of the wrong-path-for-* and *-script-but-no-*-dep

    + [FL] Actually mention which architecture we're complaining about
  * checks/manpages:
    + [FL] Report errors from man when parsing man pages. Based on
      a patch by Kevin Ryde (Closes: #285540)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [FL] Abort check if the package doesn't seem to use debconf to
      avoid false positives in case maintainers use debian/po for
      other Debian specific strings (Closes: #262749)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [FL] increase search limit for exec hack by not counting comments
      and empty lines (Closes: #294661)
    + [FL] detect more bashisms, suggested by Clint Adams and
      martin f krafft (Closes: #253498, #296233 and addresses #253012
      partly).
    + [FL] Adjust check for positional arguments after ". file" to detect
      more shell control and piping commands that are all allowed.
      Noted by Thomas Hood. (Closes: #319212)

  * reporting/html_reports:
    + [FL] Fix counting of binary package names
    + [FL] Generate mostly valid HTML (id and name attributes still

lintian (1.23.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Ah, it's LinuxTag and I still have free time!" release

  * debian/control:
    + [HE] Updated description to say that we're calibrated for Policy
      version 3.6.2. As the changes between 3.6.{1,2} aren't stuff we
      (can) check, this is actually true! (Closes: #317049)

  * testset/runtests:
    + [HE] Fix symlinking of original tarballs to allow run directories
      outside the lintian source tree.

  * checks/control-file
    + [HE] Check for duplicated fields. (Closes: #299792)

  * checks/fields:
    + [HE] Change unknown-architecture a bit: We don't complain about
      "known" non-standard archs (like amd64, ppc64, *bsd-i386) and only
      print out an info message for those. (Closes: #253405, #311471)

  * checks/files:
    + [HE] Allow backupninja configuration files in /etc/backup.d/ to be
      0600. (Closes: #307639)

    + [HE] Allow Scripts in /etc/Xsession.d/ to be not executable, as they're
      not directly called, but only sourced. (Closes: #309203)
    + [HE] Check for use of adduser and update-inetd and warn if the package
      has no (pre-)dependency on adduser/netbase. Patch by Russ Allbery,
      thanks for the work. (Closes: #308569)
    + [HE] Check for use of "." as a deprecated separator between user and
      group names in chown call. (Closes: #88340)
    + [HE] Fix to work $interpreter-script-but-no-$pkg-dep with more than one
      dependency if needed. First use case is depending on build-essential
      to provide /usr/bin/make. (Closes: #294894)
    + [HE] Add lefty as a valid interpreter and check for a correct dependency
      on graphviz. (Closes: #295093)

  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [HE] Don't allow non-PIC shared libraries. This conforms to the new
      etch release policy. Thanks for the report and patch to Kurt Roeckx
      <kurt@roeckx.be>. (Closes: #309220)

  The "Hm, this is the team's one year anniversery of maintaining lintian"
  release[1], and still using the "temporary" subversion repository...

  Featuring Steve "R." Langasek in a guest appearance.

  [1] http://lists.debian.org/debian-lint-maint/2004/01/msg00014.html

  * checks/*.desc,doc/lintian.sgml:
    + [JvW] Stop bugging us for exceptions, mmkay, just install overrides.
      Hints like this should be in the general documentation anyway, not in
      per-tag descriptions. The general documentation will now only ask to
      contact us if in doubt
  * checks/changelog-file{,desc}:
    + [JvW] (new test) Bark on @toplevel email signatures in changelogs
    + [JvW] Display invalid debmake email address upon detection
  * checks/common_data.pm:
    + [CW] Add tclx8.4 to %known_tclxs.
  * checks/description:
    + [SRL] Do not generate warnings when a short description starts with an
      article; this is good grammar and should not be discouraged.
      (Closes: #290505)
    + [JvW] Drop description-synopsis-starts-with-a-capital-letter by popular
      demand (Closes: #288568)
  * checks/files{,.desc}:
    + [JvW] Warn only for hardlinks in /etc or amongst different directories
      (Closes: #288634)
    + [JvW] Only check for desktop files in GNOME's and KDE's obsolete places,
      not in all the package, as KDE uses .desktop files also for other
      purposes (Closes: #289773)
  * checks/nmu.desc:
    + [JvW] Be more precise in explaining why lintian thinks this is a NMU,
      and copy explanation to changelog-should-mention-nmu
  * checks/scripts{,.desc}:
    + [CW] Add checks for tclsh8.4 and wish8.4. (Closes: #288287)

lintian (1.23.6) unstable; urgency=low

  The "Let's see if I can upload myself now" release, made by Marc, Frank and
  Colin, uploaded by Jeroen.

  * checks/description
    + [HE] Warn if the short description start with an article or a capital
      letter. Patch by Tobias Toedter <t.toedter@gmx.net>, thanks. (Closes:
      #258824)
  * checks/fields:
    + [HE] Warn if the debian revision has three parts, as this is the sign of
      a binary NMU. New check's name is binary-nmu-debian-revision-in-source.
      (Closes: #244830)
    + [HE] Warn if people use the Bugs field to refer to the Debian BTS, the
      new check is called redundant-bugs-field. (Closes: #245883)
  * checks/files:
    + [HE] Check that .desktop files are placed in /usr/share/applications.
      This seems to be the standard place for those files that are used
      to create menus. The check is called desktop-file-in-wrong-dir.
      (Closes: #200171)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [HE] Don't compare the manpage filename extension and the content of
      .TH case-sensitive. Report + patch by Jay Berkenbilt <ejb@ql.org>,
      thanks. (Closes: #285335)
    + [HE] Emit binary-without-english-manpage if a package only provides
      translated manpages for a binary. (Closes: #259227)
    + [HE] Skip all comment lines when checking for .so links in manpages.
      Thanks for the report and fix suggestion to Steinar H. Gunderson

  * checks/md5sums:
    + [HE] Strip off ./ at the beginning of the filenames in md5sums
      files (this seems to happen on some systems, though we don't know
      how). (Closes: #284728)
  * checks/standards-version:
    + [CW] By definition, udebs aren't required to conform to policy, so
      don't issue no-standards-version-field for them. (If they happen to
      have a Standards-Version field anyway, we still check that it's
      valid.)

  * lib/Lab.pm, frontend/lintian:
    SECURITY (CAN-2004-1000):
    + [FL] Overhaul lab directory handling. This also fixes the issue
      of removing a lab that never was created (Closes: #286681)

lintian (1.23.4) unstable; urgency=low

  The "A little pause from the sarge release work" release.

  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [FL] file has apparently changed its output format for
      symlinks sometime in the past. This broke symlink detection.
      (Closes: #276504)
  * checks/deb-format, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l2:
    + [CW] Fix binary package data member extraction to work with arbitrary
      compression algorithms instead of hardcoding data.tar.gz.
  * checks/debconf{,.desc}:
    + [FL] The SETTITLE command was introduced in debconf version
      1.3.22. Check the depends for that (Closes: #261890)
    + [FL] Warn about incorrect usage of commas in translated Choices
      fields. Patch by Denis Barbier after a suggestion by Andreas
      Metzler (Closes: #282030)

    + [FL] Update list of debhelper scripts that modify maintainer
      scripts

    + [FL] Adjust references to the menu documentation. Noted by
      Jack Moffitt (Closes: #277393)
  * checks/po-debconf{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Check for outdated .pot files when using po-debconf.
      This requires a new dependency on intltool-debian. Patch
      by Denis Barbier with corrections by JvW (Closes: #242345)
  * checks/scripts{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Fix copy-and-paste error in description
      of wrong-path-for-gnuplot (Closes: #276945)
      Thanks to Lionel Elie Mamane for reporting.
    + [FL] Add tclsh8.3 to list of valid interpreters as it is used
      in at least one package. (Closes: #280080)
    + [FL] Issue wrong-path-for-{ruby,python} even if the path contained
      a version number. Change the description of the tag to reflect that.
      (Closes: #257904)

  * frontend/lintian-info:
    + [FL] Overrides start with O:, not with 0:, d'oh!
      (Closes: #258815)

  * lib/Tags.pm:
    + [FL] Add missing "use Util;", noted by Robert Luberda

lintian (1.23.3) unstable; urgency=low

  The ``the others must be busy releasing Sarge or something'' release,
  prepared by yours truly

  * checks/conffiles.desc:
    + Note the most likely cause for duplicate-conffile in the description
      (thanks Chris Anderson for running into this problem and asking me
      about it)
  * checks/copyright-file:
    + Revert the extra pedantic check introduced in 1.23.0 that
      complained about unstrict dependencies when one as a
      /usr/share/doc/<package> that is a symlink (Closes: #249414)
  * checks/debconf:
    + Don't warn when the Choices field of a debconf question is
      not translated, often it makes no sense to translate it
      (Closes: #262649)
  * checks/debhelper:
    + dh-make also creates sample files named .EX, so make that check
      case-insensitive (Closes: #251262)
  * checks/fields.desc:
    + Adjust package-has-a-duplicate-relation to warning, and note that
      this sometimes happens to you when using ${shlibs:Depends}, and you
      shouldn't bother too much if that's the case (Closes: #274286)
      Thanks Peter Eisentraut for the suggestion
    + Fix English language depends-on-essential-package-without-using-version,
      thanks to Peter Eisentrautf for noticing (Closes: #261603)
    + [FL] Clone depends-on-essential-package-without-using-version as
      build-depends-on-essential-package-without-using-version to give
      correct policy reference (Closes: #261602)
  * checks/init.d:
    + Don't warn for missing init.d scripts in package and conffile list
      if a variable is used instead of a real name (Closes: #264218)
  * checks/manpages.desc:
    + Demote binary-without-manpage to warning, and adjust description,
      to be consistent with policy, which says a manpage should be available
      (and doesn't use "must" for it). Thanks to Robert Millan for his patch
      (Closes: #271014)
  * checks/nmu.desc:
    + Note in source-nmu-has-incorrect-version-number's description that
      the mistake could also be the other way around (Closes: #258604)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + Don't give missing-file-from-potfile-in on empty lines
      (Thanks Adam Conrad for noticing)
  * checks/scripts:
    + The php commandline interpreter is now provided by php4-cli, and
      not php4-cgi, update dependency check accordingly (Closes: #268077)
    + Give an error if the 'config' script uses a non-essential
      interpreter (Closes: #274832)
  * checks/shared-libraries:
    + Ignore comments in shlibs files (Closes: #275124)

    + Document that you can use comments in overrides (Closes: #87805)

  * frontend/lintian:
    + Fix overrides so that they allow all of (1) <package> <type>:,
      (2) <package>:, and (3) <nothing> as prefix to tags you want to
      override, and modify documentation accordingly. This used to be buggy

lintian (1.23.1) unstable; urgency=low

  The ``Now featuring over 500 checks'' release, prepared by the usual
  suspects.

  * checks/*:
    + [JvW] Changed from executables to check-plugins
    + [HE] Drop the misuse of charset when we want to say "encoding".
      Renamed 2 tests for that:
      unknown-charset-in-po-file -> unknown-encoding-in-po-file
      debian-changelog-file-uses-obsolete-national-charset ->
      debian-changelog-file-uses-obsolete-national-encoding
      (Closes: #248194)
  * checks/binaries:
    + [FL] Change check for binary-compiled-with-profiling-enabled on
      hppa to look for _mcount instead of __gmon_start__ since the
      latter can't be used as an indicator on that arch (Closes: #207063)
    + [JvW] Exempt ocaml binaries from the 'is the binary stripped?' test,
      since they cannot be stripped harmlessly. See #256900 (Closes: #252695)
    + [JvW] Parse the output of file a little bit more strict, and make it
      consequent across checks (Closes: #257898)
  * checks/changelog-files{,.desc}:
    + [HE] New check latest-debian-changelog-entry-without-new-date, comparing
      the dates of the last 2 changelog entries. (Closes: #111215)
    + [FL] New tag invalid-date-in-changelog which is issued if
      latest-debian-changelog-entry-without-new-date encounters a
      parse error
  * checks/common-data.pm:
    + [JvW] Add libgl(u)-dev to list of virtual packages (Closes: #255595)
    + [JvW] Added amd64 to list of known architectures, as the name has
      settled and it'll likely enter the archive soonish (Closes: #257503)
  * checks/control-file{,.desc}:
    + [HE] Introduced new check script. New checks:
      - build-info-in-binary-control-file-section, triggered
        by a Build-* field in a binary section (Closes: #94928)
      - debian-control-file-uses-obsolete-national-encoding, stolen from
        changelog-file (Closes: #247197)
  * checks/cruft{,.desc}:
    + [JvW] cvsignore-file-in-source is now info, because it happens so often
      by upstream, and is only very minor in size
    + [HE] New check: source-contains-cvs-conflict-copy, triggered by
      .#file.version files. They are created by cvs when it tries to merge
      local changes and an update from the repo. (Closes: #246060)
    + [JvW] Also check for source-contains-svn-conflict-copy (for .r123 and
      .mine files)
  * checks/debhelper:
    + [FL] Avoid Perl warning about undefined values. Noted by JvW.
  * checks/fields{,.desc}:
    + [JvW] Added debian-revision-should-not-be-zero, suggested by Adam
      Conrad
    + [FL] Downgrade build-depends-without-arch-dep to warning as it's
      heuristic. Reword explanation. This partly handles #247171.
    + [JvW] For build-depends-without-arch-dep, fix detection of debhelper
      usage in clean when used by means of CDBS (combined with above change,
      now fully closes: #247171)
    + [HE] Check Build-Depends(-Indep) for virtual packages without a
      real dependency. Fix based on patch by Steinar H. Gunderson
      <sgunderson@bigfoot.com>. (Closes: #255593)
    + [HE] Don't issue virtual-package-depends-without-real-package-depends
      if this happens in Suggests. (Closes: #254367)
    + [FL] Allow whitespace in relations after the version number
  * checks/huge-usr-share:
    + [FL] Skip check for packages that don't have usr/share at all
      (Closes: #247708)
  * checks/manpages:
    + [FL] Comment check for no-manpage-in-correct-directory out until
      I know if it's worth keeping it at all (Closes: #253011)
      Thanks to Stephen Stafford for pointing this out.
  * checks/menus:
    + [FL] Fix regex which checks for update-menus calls (missing
      whitespace) and allow path before executable name (perhaps this
      should be another warning, though?) (Closes: #254420)
    + [FL] Some clean-up and warn that wm-menu-config is deprecated
      (Closes: #248997)
    + [FL] Demote executable-in-usr-lib-menu to warning as executables
      are supported (but seldomly used) (Closes: #254498)
  * checks/menu-format:
    + [FL] Fix su-to-root checks to cope with the new -X option and
      improve the option parsing to better handle unknown options
    + [FL] Allow a comma separated list in the package test. Pointed
      out by Gerfried Fuchs (Closes: #246507) Change incorrect-package-test
      to pkg-not-in-package-test which is issued when the package is
      not in the list. Don't issue menu-command-not-in-package when
      we have a list.
    + [FL] Commands for window manager's modules can't be expected
      to be available as executables, so don't issue
      menu-command-not-in-package in this case. Thanks to
      Manoj Srivastava for reporting (Closes: #247805)
    + [HE] Change menu-command-not-in-package to also look into the standard
      PATH. (Closes: #255155)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [JvW] Simply fail if stuff from gettext is missing.
  * checks/scripts:
    + [FL] Don't issue executable-not-elf-or-script for files
      that are named *.exe (Closes: #251075, #255083)
    + [CW] Add python2.4 as a valid interpreter (Closes: #254482)
    + [FL] Add ruby1.[68] as valid interpreters, introduce new
      ruby-script-but-no-ruby-dep error, copied from the python stuff
    + [FL] Don't issue script-not-executable for menu-methods. There
      are reasons why they are sometimes not executable (Closes: #250632)
    + [FL] 'and' and 'or' are no bash keywords (Closes: #194283)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [FL] Don't report shlib-with-executable-bit and
      shlib-with-bad-permissions on symbolic links to such files
    + [JvW] Fix the pic-detection code (Closes: #185816)

  * debian/{control,rules}, frontend/lintian:
    + [JvW] Insert version number at package build time, no need to commit a
      change to frontend/lintian on every version number change... Requires
      sed version 4 at build-time.
    + [JvW] Start depending on gettext.
    + [JvW] Start depending on libdigest-md5-perl on woody, for using md5 on
      files.

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [JvW] Partial rewrite: checks are now plugins loaded into lintian,
      rather than executed as separate executables. Makes it easy to make
      common functions available, tags are done centrally, etc etc. Should
      also save quite a number of forks, thus more speedier.

lintian (1.23.0) unstable; urgency=low

  The ``moving forward'' release, prepared by Marc 'HE' Brockschmidt,
  Frank Lichtenheld and Jeroen van Wolffelaar.

  * [FL] add udeb support (Closes: #216117)
    Thanks to Joey Hess for his input. Many changes, mostly to
    frontend/lintian, checks/debconf and checks/files

  * checks/binaries:
    + [JvW] Ignore static binaries in /usr/lib/debug
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [HE] Check for the debmake template email address in the changelog
      entries. Patch by Steffen Moeller <moeller@pzr.uni-rostock.de>,
      thanks! (Closes: #199903)
    + [JvW] Loosen up checks for -0.x versions, could be either native or
      upstream + Debian revision, so some tests cannot be performed because of
      that uncertainty
  * checks/copyright-file:
    + [HE] Change usr-doc-symlink-to-foreign-package check to throw an
      error when a package doesn't depend on the *same* version of the
      package its /usr/share/doc/$foo dir is symlinked to. This is supposed
      to ensure that both come from the same source and the same source
      version. (Closes: #201470)
  * checks/cruft.desc:
    + [HE] Reworded some parts and bumped the Standards-Version after
      checking for changes. (Closes: #235735)
  * checks/debconf{,.desc}:
    + [JvW] Add an error for a bogus default for a boolean template
      (Closes: #236846)
    + [HE] Check for duplicate fields in templates. Fix based on
      patch by Denis Barbier <barbier@linuxfr.org>, thanks! (Closes: #233116)
    + [HE] Check if the translation of a Choices: field is empty, leading to
      skipped questions. (Closes: #149451)
  * checks/debdiff:
    + [HE] Check for accidental native packaging. This is done by checking for
      a dash in the version number (though -0.\d+ and -0.\d+.\d+ are allowed
      for (binary) NMUs) and the existence of a .diff.gz. (Closes: #216327)
    + [JvW] Implement source-tar-is-posix-tar, which checks for upstream
      tarballs that are tar --posix tarballs, which cannot be untarred by the
      tar version in woody (Closes: #245138)
  * checks/debhelper{,.desc}:
    + [JvW] Add error if debian/compat is empty, happens once in current
      sid and gave internal error before
  * checks/debian-readme:
    + [HE] Add check for the debmake template email address. Patch by Steffen
      Moeller <moeller@pzr.uni-rostock.de>, thanks!
  * checks/deb-format:
    + [HE] Add a check for the data member of a deb. dpkg 1.11 introduces
      support for configurable compression algorithms (bzip2, for example),
      but this shouldn't be allowed before dpkg 1.11 hits stable.
      (Closes: #159874)
  * checks/fields:
    + [HE, FL] Nearly complete rewrite for clean up:
      - bad-relation seems to work better now (Closes: #171763)
      - duplicate relations checking now works for different fields, too
        (Closes: #234978, #235356)
    + [HE] Add check for an Origin field with "Debian" as value.
      (Closes: #119618)
    + [HE] Reintroduce build-depends-without-arch-dep check with the patch
      I proposed in #214231. (Closes: #242484)
    + [JvW] Check for well-formed Debian-revision
    + [JvW] Check for correct realname when QA mailaddress used
  * checks/fields.desc:
    + [FL] Fix some wrong policy references
  * checks/files:
    + [HE] New check for compiled python files (*.pyc). Patch by David
      Kimdon <david@kimdon.org>, thanks. (Closes: #236606)
    + [HE] Check for gzipped zero byte files. (Closes: #172052)
    + [FL] Don't complain about read-only *.ali files as requested by
       Ludovic Brenta. This makes #226879 wishlist again.
    + [FL] Warn about ancient files with the value of
      Dinstall::CutOffPastYear from dak CVS as limit.
      (Closes: #204801, #218304)
    + [HE] Check for *.ali files introduced, warn if their permissions are !=
      0444. (Closes: #226879)
    + [HE] New checks for deprecated X11 dirs (/usr/{bin,lib,include}/X11 and
      usr/X11R6/*). (Closes: #81004)
    + [HE] Check for README for other distributions/platforms and warn if
      they're installed. Based on patch by Jay Bonci. (Closes: #178441)
  * checks/init.d:
    + [FL] output-of-updaterc.d-not-redirected-to-dev-null should be
      only a info tag since it is more a aesthetical issue, not a
      policy violation. (Closes: #149700)
  * checks/lintian.desc:
    + [JvW] Added missing Type: tags
  * checks/manpages:
    + [FL] New checks:
       - Section number of directory and file differ
       - Section number of file differs from what is expected
         from the location of the binary. (Closes: #203831)
    + [FL] Parse contents of man page and implement more new checks:
      - Section number of file and header differ (Closes: #89488)
      - Try to search for hyphens that should be minus signs
        (Closes: #205924). First patch by Eduard Bloch, final
        regex by Josip Rodin.
      - Search for FSSTND directories referenced in man pages. Only
        an info tag. (Closes: #111098)
    + [FL, HE] Fix false positives of
      manpage-for-non-x11-binary-in-wrong-directory when a link
      from a normal bin/ is pointing to a binary in an X11 dir. Based
      on patch by FL. (Closes: #203389)
    + [JvW] x11-games-should-be-in-usr-games is now error, because it's
      mandated by policy
  * checks/menus:
    + [JvW] Stricter checking for whether update-menus is actually called
      (Closes: #244628)
  * checks/menu-format:
    + [FL] Only issue one warning about needs=dwww, not two
    + [HE] Check if the command given with command= is in the package
      (Closes: #199346)
  * checks/nmu{,desc}:
    + [JvW] New series of checks: Check whether NMU's have correct NMU version
      number, and whether maintainer uploads have correct maintainer version.
      Also, check whether NMU's and QA uploads are identified as such in the
      changelog (Closes: #111948)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [FL] Add /usr/bin/php as valid interpreter. (Closes: #239115)
      Thanks to Peter Eisentraut for pointing this change out
    + [FL] Reflect new suidperl handling. /usr/bin/suidperl
      shouldn't/can't be called directly anymore so add a new
      error and remove it from the list of usual interpreters.
      (Closes: #240806)
    + [HE] Don't warn about files with a shebang line which are not executable
      when they are called *in, as they're probably just templates. (Closes:
      #114740)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [HE] Add some new logic to cope with symlinks from /usr/lib to another
      dir to fix false positives of postrm-has-useless-call-to-ldconfig and
      friends. (Closes: #190714)
    + [HE] Also handle case statements in postrm scripts. (Closes: #179435)
  * checks/standards-version:
    + [JvW] Also emit warning if standards version is 3.6.0, and not yet 3.6.1

  * collection/diffstat
    + [HE] The diff.gz file name does not include the the epoch, so strip it
      before trying to get the file.
  * collection/override-file:
    + [FL] add support for source overrides (Closes: #129510)
      See the User Manual for more information.
  * collection/source-control-file:
    + [FL] New collection script to extract field information
      from debian/control in source packages. Currently used
      in checks/debhelper to guess udeb packages.

  * debian/control,debian/copyright:
    + [FL] Add Marc 'HE' Brockschmidt to Uploaders and
      to copyright file

  * doc/lintian.sgml:
    + [FL] Some updates, some more verbatim explantions
      (Closes: #197955)
    + [FL] Reworked the override section to handle udeb and
      source packages, too
  * doc/README:
    + [FL] Update options

  * frontend/lintian:
    + [HE] Added a --dont-check-parts|-X option to allow users to specify
      which tests should not be run. Also added infos about this to the
      manpage. (Closes: #206674)
  * frontend/lintian-info:
    + [JvW] Fixed that lintian -I also displays info for I: entries

  * lib/Dep.pm:
    + [FL] Fixed some semantic errors (since noone ever observed the
      correspoding perl warnings the fixed parts are probably never
      used in the current code)
  * lib/Utils.pm
    + [HE] Changed {read,parse}_dpkg_control a bit to cope with the fact
      that template files sometimes contain lines consisting only of
      whitespace which do *not* separate to blocks. (Closes: #242479)

  * testset/runtests:
    + [JvW] Rewrote so that it is actually useful:
      - sort output to nullify filesystem directory ordering differences
      - run lintian just once
      - check that all tests that are triggered have a description, if verbose
        specified, warn about tests that are not tested

  * unpack/list-binpkg:
    + [HE] Try to open Packages.gz if no Packages file can be found. Fix
      based on patch by Robert Lemmen <robertle@semistable.com>, thanks!
      (Closes: #198617)

lintian (1.22.12) unstable; urgency=low

  The ``Fix those false positives, mkay'' release, prepared for all Debian
  Maintainers by Frank Lichtenheld and Jeroen van Wolffelaar.
  Best served cold.

  * debian/control:
    + [FL] Make Uploaders a single line field. It didn't really
      break, but at least DDPO had its difficulties

  * man/lintian.1:
    + [FL] sync man page with the --help output by adding missing options
      Based on a patch by Robert Lemmen. (Closes: #198615)
    + [FL] sync man page with the current list of checks and collection
      scripts

  * checks/binaries:
    + [FL] Don't complain about non-stripped kernel modules.
      Patch by Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaker (Closes: #203373)
    + [JvW] Exclude binaries and packages named *-static from the
      binary-is-static test. Exception for sash removed. (Closes: #215235)
  * checks/changelog-file:
    + [FL] Check that encoding of changelog file is UTF-8, based on a patch by
      Denis Barbier (Closes: #175318)
  * checks/copyright-file{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Don't advise to point to the perl packages' copyright file.
      Thanks to Martin Orr for pointing this out. (Closes: #193293)
    + [FL] Fixed false positives of
      copyright-should-refer-to-common-license-file-for-gpl due to
      the GFDL. Thanks to Ross Burton for reporting this. (Closes: #192278)
  * checks/deb-format{,.desc}:
    + [JvW] Fix perl variable-name clash causing unusually formatted error
      output (only important if you do automatic processing on it)
    + [FL] The current script is by Denis Barbier, correcting author in
      .desc file
  * checks/debhelper.desc:
    + [FL] correct reference to debhelper manpage. It's debhelper(7), not
      debhelper(1). Thanks to Brian Nelson for pointing this out
      (Closes: #188245)
  * checks/debconf:
    + [JvW] Update valid types, since currently 'title' is supported now too
      (Closes: #234379, #234608)

    + [FL] fix description-is-dh_make-template check. (Closes: #215125)
      Fix suggested by Josip Rodin
  * checks/etcfiles.desc:

      is already used by init.d
  * checks/fields:
    + [FL] Really check only "real" dependency fields for needlessy
      depends (Closes: #185035)
    + [JvW] Don't consider depending on coreutils bad, as this is in a way a
      versioned depend (Closes: #216536)
    + [FL] Remove the build-depends-without-arch-dep check. It produces
      way too much false positives and can only be replaced by
      a sophisticated debian/rules parser
      (Closes: #192037, #202950, #214231)
    + [JvW] Test syntax of Uploaders: too
    + [JvW] Accept more whitespace in relations, which is allowed according to
      policy, thanks Adrian Bunk for noticing, FL for patch (Closes: #200280)
  * checks/filenames:
    + [JvW] Revised the symlink detection stuff, it is now more rigorous, and
      has seperate warning for recursive symlinks that are otherwise not
      necessarily wrong (Closes: #118080)
  * checks/files:
    + [FL] only issue package-installs-nonbinary-perl-in-usr-lib-perl5 if
      there is no binary perl file at all in the package, since this
      reflects the way the Installer module behaves (Closes: #199898)
  * checks/huge-usr-share:
    + [JvW] Check for a big /usr/share (currently 1-2MB will trigger it) in
      arch-dependent packages. Currently just I:. Thanks Steve McIntyre for
      the idea. (Closes: #232849)
  * checks/menus{,.desc}:
    + [FL] Remove non-exectuable-in-etc-menu-methods as it doesn't
      reflects the current menu manual (Closes: #229460)
  * checks/po-debconf:
    + [JvW] Check whether files listed in debian/po/POTFILES.in actually

      modified)
  * checks/scripts:
    + [FL] Fix check for "exec ..." line. Fix suggested by Josip Rodin.
      (Closes: #212811)
    + [JvW] Tighten up mknod, dpkg --print-architecture and killall detection
      in maintainer scripts, would need rewrite to be really sane.
      (Closes: #148548, #161820, #192300)
  * checks/shared-libs:
    + [FL] Be more tolerant to variations when checking for
      postrm-unsafe-ldconfig. Thanks to Martin Godisch, Steinar H. Gunderson
      and Aidas Kasparas for their input. (Closes: #218543, #233740)

    + [FL] tar uses now h to signal hardlinks which breaks a lot of our code.
      so sed'ing it away. Many many thanks to Theodore Y. Ts'o for bringing
      this to our attention (Closes: #234545)

       also closes: #190067)
   * checks/po-debconf
     + Rewrite in Perl
     + Obsolete PO files are no more checked because po2debconf now
       automatically runs debconf-updatepo if PO files are older than
       templates files.  Of course PO files might be outdated (e.g. when
       downloaded from a BR), but it should occur seldom.
     + PO files are processed through msgfmt to ensure they are valid.

  * config.* files from 2000-09-05 and such had the timestamp in a

  * Don't require \S+ but .+ while parsing @packages, closes: #172444.
  * Rewrote the chunk of code dealing with names of manual pages, because
    it was done all wrong, closes: #173548.
  * Ignore files consisting merely of .so links completely, thanks to
    Matej Vela, closes: #173609.
  * Added code to check for bad-so-link-within-manual-page.
  * Also added code to check for empty-manual-page.
  * Added a few more cases of safe ldconfig invocation in postrm,
    closes: #174042. Didn't handle the one with the "case" statement,
    it's too bothersome. Oh well, the check is a warning instead of
    an error for a reason.
  * Added a check for the timestamp line in config.guess/sub files,
    closes: #171295.
  * Renamed the full-stop check to
    description-synopsis-might-not-be-phrased-properly and rephrased its
    description. This is where I draw the line :) closes: #174150.
  * Added a warning on .pl and .pm files within /usr/lib/perl5,

lintian (1.22.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in copyright-should-refer-to-common-license-file-for-gpl

    the pipe to lintian-info before the first print E: line so that
    bad-distribution-in-changes-file and other tags in lintian.desc
    actually get displayed, closes: #171737.
  * Updated the description of link-to-undocumented-manpage to better
    match the current Policy and be more helpful.
  * Added missing \Q and \E around the variable in
    description-synopsis-is-duplicated, closes: #171721.
  * Don't warn on _any_ mention of update-rc.d in postinst, just those that
    follow whitespace or something else and a semicolon, closes: #171472.

lintian (1.22.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed some random glitches.
  * Change rgb-vs-cmap to first include the hex codes of colors in cmap.xpm,
    and then go searching for names in rgb.txt. Updated the cmap.xpm
    location in the description. This hopefully really closes: #170860.
  * Added exception in the shell syntax checks for evil rep scripts,
    thanks to Kevin Ryde, closes: #171175.
  * Added checks for multiple dependencies on libstdc, tcl, tclx, tk, tkx
    and libpng packages. This is currently beind done in a hardcoded manner,
    but that should do for now, closes: #80447, #129548.
  * Added a regression test as part of the relations regression test for
    the above multiple dependencies.
  * Don't barf on /var/local in the FSSTND-dir-in-var check, just in
    non-standard-dir-in-var, closes: #119414. The normal packages
    shouldn't install anything there anyway, and base-files can have
    overrides :)
  * Prepend a slash to the file names in file-in-etc-not-marked-as-conffile,
    closes: #122285. We already don't have the prepended thing normalized,
    so why not indulge this.
  * Added dh_suidregister-is-obsolete, closes: #94031.
  * Added copyright-lists-upstream-authors-with-dh_make-boilerplate,
    closes: #107815. I am now the official maintainer so I get to do that >:)
    This time I've written the description much better, so there should
    be no confusion like there was the last time.
  * Added description-synopsis-is-duplicated first by comparing the
    lowercased synopsis with the lowercased start of the extended
    description, and then if that fails, the letters and numbers are
    removed and the strings are compared. This may not catch _everything_,
    but should be satisfactory, and it closes: #118098.
  * Added a regression test for the above error to the other relations test.
    It seemed handy. :)
  * Added an error for depending on libdb1-compat, just in case, as advised
    by Colin Watson.

  * Warn on dh_dhelp use, thanks to Chris Tillman, closes: #130016.
  * Exempt awk from the virtual-package-depends-without-real-package-depends
    check, and add an error when there's a non-versioned dependency on awk,
    closes: #136831. The description may be considered vague for some
    cases, but I'll wait until someone actually complains about that
    before rewriting it.
  * Moved the generic exceptions before the script-without-interpreter check,
    which should fix Daniel Kobras' dx false positive, closes: #165574.
  * Added a warning for full stop in the synopsis line, thanks to
    Colin Walters, closes: #131747.
  * Added a warning for daemon stopping stuff in postinst, without
    a dependency on debconf (>= 1.2.9), thanks to Martin Godisch,
    closes: #168621.
  * Based on hints from in Jim Van Zandt's otherwise rather flawed patch
    posted in bug #94928, moved the diff file stuff from the cruft check
    into the diffstat collector, and made it simply extract the patch into
    a file called "debian-patch" which is then used elsewhere, instead of
    zcatting it over and over again.
  * Added a regression test for the debian/files and config.* checks.
  * Added config.log to the list of configure-generated files to warn about.
  * Updated menu icon colors with a little script I wrote, closes: #170860.
  * It appears File::Find has changed semantics since woody and now refuses
    to follow a symlink as the name of the directory to scan. Obviously,
    a simple readlink() fixes it.
  * I realized that bug #122855 couldn't have been fixed the diff scanning
    code anyhow, since dpkg-source ignores file deletions in the first place.
    Removed the hours of work and simply expanded on the description of the
    error instead. Oh well.
  * Added an error for GPL copyrights that don't refer to
    /usr/share/common-licenses, thanks to Edward Betts, closes: #99885.

  * Accept /var/games as an exception for setgid stuff, closes: #169382.
  * Removed the /etc/ppp perms exception as per discussion on debian-devel.
  * Fixed the add-log-mailing-address check by not re-my-ing the prefix
    and suffix variables in each iteration of the loop, closes: #129581.
    Added the word obsolete in the name of the error and a paragraph break
    to further clarify it.
  * Added Apps/Science as a valid menu section. This and the removal of
    the error for calling ldconfig anywhere in the postinst in 1.21.5

  * Make .nfs* files trigger the backup-file-in-package check, closes: #95140.

  * There doesn't appear to be any provision in the Policy or in the FHS
    for random compatibility symlinks, so I've just added "or symbolic
    link" to the description of file-in-unusual-dir, closes: #135546.
  * Fixed the regexp for package-contains-CVS-dir to actually recognize

  * Made unregistered-script-in-etc-init.d a warning, renamed it to
    script-in-etc-init.d-not-registered-via-update-rc.d and updated
    its description to mention why it may not be an error, closes: #118823.
  * Added dash into the regexps in the scripts check.
  * Added a crude check for code within another shell (foosh -c something).
    I say crude because it works with oneliners only -- anything that spans
    lines sounds like pretty much impossible to do in without actually
    _being_ a shell script interpreter :) closes: #166483.
  * Added an exception for /etc/ppp being 750 root:dip, and complain if

    Also extend the checking of that directory on all X.Y and not just 1.5.
  * Fixed policy references in several init script related tags, made the
    init.d not conffile check a warning since Policy allows otherwise and we
    can't check reliably, extended the rc.d file check on rc(\d|S).d and
    excluded sysvinit and file-rc from the check. All this closes: #118824.

    and #162813 to the submitters, but I'll have to wait and see, since
    I still can't reproduce it myself.
  * Fixed the cruft check not to check the diff file just once, not for

    to allow several paths like that... perhaps the same should be done

  * Added Colin's patch check manual pages for correctness with lexprog,

  * Cleaned up some typos in copyrights.
  * Added *sh -n checking for syntax errors in shell scripts, closes: #42348.
  * Moved script checks from control-files to the second part of scripts,
    and also noticed and fixed a bug -- if a script e.g. called killall and
    had a bashism on the same line, it would escape undetected.
  * Check the .diff.gz file (if it exists) for config.(cache|status) that
    includes no added and a number of removed lines and don't print the

  * added 'debain' to list of spelling errors.  Closes: #112083.
  * applied Steve Kowalik's patch that adds out-of-date-standards-version.
    This will be defined as the policy shipped with the last stable release.
    Closes: #112043.
  * Made doc-base-references-usr-doc inform which file is the culprit.
    Closes: #111020.
  * Applied Steve M. Robbins' patch for improved handling of ldconfig checks
    in maintainer scripts.  Closes: #110465, #113285.
  * do not complain about static binaries if they are called "foo.static".
    Closes: #98288.
  * testset/runtests now calls dpkg-buildpackage with a '-d' so build-depends
    are not checked.
  * oops I left 'debian' in the spelling check list.
  * backed out Gergely Nagy's suggestion for checking for 'Author(s)'.  That
    is just overly pedantic and lame.  Reopens: #107815, tagged wontfix.
  * checks/etcfiles now complains about ANY file found in /etc that is not a
    conffile.  The finer grain checks have been removed.  Closes: #103940.
    Added a new testset 'etcfiles' to go along with the test.
  * debconf check now looks for the 'seen' flag and gives an error if the
    package does not have a versioned dependency on debconf 0.5.00.

    after the last such NMU. :)
  * Fixed spurious postinst-has-useless-call-to-ldconfig warnings, patch
    from Colin Watson, closes: #109721. Also fixed the silly error in
    shared-libs which broke shlib-missing-in-control-file.
  * Fixed checking for /var/lib/games, patch from Andrew Suffield, amended
    by me not to warn for the files but just that dir, closes: #109970.
  * Have debian-changelog-file-contains-user-emacs-settings checked only

lintian (1.20.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload blessed by the maintainer. Kudos to Colin Watson
    and Steve Kowalik for helping in the preparation of this upload.
  * Skip shared objects which aren't in %ldso_dir in some shlib checks,
    as per changes in Policy 3.5.5, finally closes: #42399, #41613.
  * Fixed Policy section in package-contains-upstream-install-documentation,
    closes: #94267.
  * Added Adrian Bunk's patch for pike/pike7 stuff, along with pike7 stuff
    in checks/scripts.desc so it's consistent, closes: #94902.
  * Added an error for leaving files generated by autoconf in the source
    package, patch from Colin Watson, closes: #107679, #94316.
    This pulled in renaming checks/debian-cruft* to cruft*, logically.
  * Added checks/infofiles* for everything related to info files, moved
    parts of checks/menus* in it and added compression related errors,
    closes: #95785.
  * Added Brendan O'Dea's patch for checking Perl module directories,
    and for not checking the source for each matching file in a !$is_python
    package, closes: #96350.
  * Removed lc() from checks on whether a debconf field value is valid,
    closes: #106324.
  * Improved binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath description, closes: #94901.
  * Fixed the references to /usr/doc in the manual page using the patch
    from Stephen Stafford, closes: #103177.
  * Added debconf's "config" among %maintainer_scripts in
    checks/control-files, closes: #108123.
  * Added "Debian/GNU Linux" among the corrections in checks/spelling,
    closes: #35761. It required some other modifications but oh well.
  * Added a new warning, doc-base-file-references-usr-doc, closes: #46582.
    This required adding collection/doc-base-files* and using that in
    checks/menus*.
  * Added a new error, debian-changelog-file-contains-user-emacs-settings,
    closes: #84750. This required using collection/changelog-file in
    checks/changelog-file (doh! :).
  * Complains on manual pages located in /usr/(share|X11R6)/man instead of
    man* subdirs, closes: #93056.
  * Added php4 as a valid interpreter, closes: #94534.
  * Fixed a little bug in checks/spelling.desc, it lacked a comma in its
    Needs-Info field.
  * Added a warning when there's common-licenses and not
    /usr/share/common-licenses/ in the copyright file, closes: #99886.
  * Added a warning when there's "Upstream Author(s)" in the copyright file,
    closes: #107815.
  * Removed -v from command(1) invocation check, patch from Colin Watson,
    closes: #96227.
  * Mention the language in select-with-translated-default-field and
    partially-translated-question, patch from Colin Watson, closes: #95795.
    Also, fixed some thinkos in the code for the latter warning.
  * No longer barfs on debhelper-generated safe ldconfig calls, patch from
    Paul Martin, closes: #82479.
  * Added the recent Policy versions up to 3.5.6 to standards-version,
    and moved the threshold for ancient versions up to 3.2.0 because that
    version was released a bit more than one year ago, closes: #104766.
  * Added a new error, package-depends-on-an-x-font-package. The pattern
    is ^xfont.*, that ought to work fine (xfntil2 et al will go undetected,
    but that's obsolete).
  * Colin tweaked lib/text_utils.pl to display indented and empty stuff in
    Info: tags properly.

    need a testset for this too
  * checks/files.desc now points to the FHS in /usr/share/doc/debian-policy
  * applied Joey Hess' app-defaults patch.  This allows app-defaults to be
    conffiles as well as adding a check for app-defaults in old dirs.
    Closes: #86707, #76811
  * lintian now knows more about 3.5.x's X policy in 12.8.  Added check for
    Xresources file but no conflicts on xbase (<< 3.3.2.3a-2).  Closes: #63542
  * applied Joey Hess's perl patch.  Now know that pm's in /usr/share have
    no need for the +x bit.  Closes: #86709
  * check for INSTALL in /usr/share/doc now knows about INSTALL\..+ (i.e.

    relation (ie Build-Depends) but are not at least policy 3.1.x.

  * bashism checks now ignore here documents, Closes: #87527
    teset/maintainer-scripts now has a here document in a script and extended

  * typo in scripts fixed, now I really do work on python2, thanks Jerome.
    Closes: #87772

  * removed the -w and strict from reporting/ scripts
  * update-menus checks enhanced with knowledge about wm-menu-config.

lintian (1.20.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * 'people who depend on side effects should be flogged' release
  * lintian had code which set a variable to undef, then used it.  Without
    -w and use strict, this silently became a zero, but now it causes errors.
    So, since it obviously was meant to be zero, I set it to zero instead of
    undef.  Closes: #85326
    Fun part was this only happened when run on more than one version of a
    single package i.e. lintian foo_1.changes foo_2.changes.
  * checks/scripts updated to deal with python2.x and there being two versions
    of python.  Closes: #85441
    while doing this, collections/scripts was updated to support the use of
    /usr/bin/env.  I probably added bugs here )-:
    added a scripts testset, very early still.
  * my modification to checks/menus to support /usr/share/doc/package -> other
    had a problem with special chars.  Now calls quotemeta().  Annoying because
    I have a ++ package name but it did not trigger this particular case.
    So, I added a package to foo++ which links to foo++.  Closes: #85530

  * checks/shared-libs handles libraries of the form 'libfoo-X.X.so' now
  * the virtual package check I added in the last release failed to check
    the field it was testing, so errors were reported on fields other than
    Depends.  Ooops.  The description also should have referred to packaging
    not policy.  Closes: #85225

  * 'why would you ever do THAT?' release
  * lintian-info sets $ENV{'LINTIAN_ROOT'} if it is not set
  * added a check to checks/files for packages which ship the upstream INSTALL
    document.  This is almost always useless for users of a package.
    testset/binary now includes such a file
    Closes: #81970
  * checks/menus -- the walk over package contents now has logic to run file
    tests on files, link tests on links, etc.
  * checks/menus -- if there is a /usr/share/doc/$pkg symlink, assume it links
    to a package it depends on and do not warn about setting the usr/doc
    symlink.  There is code in checks/copyright-file that makes sure policy is
    followed with regards to what is actually linked against.  Closes: #48048
  * checks/fields is now less strict about Section: non-US handling
  * added debconf files to list of known control files in checks/control-files
    Closes: #46863
  * perl mistakes are no longer checked for. Closes: #47076, #75889
  * FHS 2.1 cleanups, Closes: #75878
  * lintian will not complain if you symlink your doc directory to an essential
    package and leave off the depends, because since it is essential you must
    not depend on it.  Closes: #48296
  * lintian now gives and error when a package declares a depends on an
    essential package without using a versioned depends.  Closes: #33250
  * extra-license-file is not given if the file is just a symlink.
    Closes: #35224
  * checks/fields: now complain if a package declares a depends on a virtual
    package without first depending on a real packages as an alternative.
    Required adding a known_virtual_packages list to checks/common_data.pl.
    Also removed redundant info/registered-virtual-packages file.
    Closes: #70673
  * added a library (mostly empty right now) and non-us testset
  * runtests now runs the tests in alphabetical order
  * lintian's --version info is being updated automagically again
  * moved some hashes around in checks/ to common_data.pl
  * checks/changelog-file reorganized so it knows the size of the files.  Now
    it can check that the changelog is sufficiently large to require
    compressing.  Also modified the desc file to reflect this. Closes: #84400
  * --info now outputs all info.  Silly bug in how I used split and defined.
    Closes: #82970
  * added a testset/check_info.pl script.  It verifies that every lintian
    check referenced in a desc also has an info section.  runtests now runs
    this test as well.
  * suidregister warning is now an error.
  * checks/menus: fixed the if link case pattern match -- one more perl erro
    down, 3 billion hidden ones to go.
  * Following items thanks to Colin Watson
  * updated checks/standards-version so it does not give perl errors when it
    encounters a newer standards version than it knows about. Closes: #84083
  * updated references to policy for policy 3.5.0. Closes: #84088, #83969
  * Added a warning for packages containing a link to undocumented(7) as
    suggested on debian-policy list.  Also includes a testset (manpages)
    addition.
    Closes: #83188
  * At the moment checks/copyright-file just tests for a slash in the link;
    I've changed it here to test for an initial / or ../, and then after that
    check it strips off everything from the first slash on, so that tests on
    the package name work correctly when people link to subdirectories of
    other /usr/share/doc directories.  Closes: #84066
  * It was unpacking to level 2 even though I had Unpack-Level: 1 and no
    associated collection scripts. Of course, it wanted override files from
    /usr/share/lintian/overrides/$pkg. Fair enough - except that if I said
    --no-override it wanted the override file information anyway, and still
    unpacked to level 2.  No obeys non-overrides.  Closes: #84722

    not only is this silly but it makes regression tests impossible

  * typo in checks/control-files in a bashism check, the correct POSIX call
    is 'read foo' however the code was checking for the existance of whitespace
    before the call, not the existance of the variable to read into due to a
    mixed up regex.  Thanks Adam Heath for pointing this out. Closes: #81453
  * checks/control-files, the check for whether '.' takes more than one
    argument did not take into account things like 'and'.  It does now.
    Closes: #81737

    the old messages suidregister-used-in-maintainer-script-other-than-postinst

  * Zapped compiled-with-bad-libc check.
  * Corrected spelling error in spelling check (it flagged "interchangeable"
    as a bad word; this should have been "interchangable").  This fixes
    bug#33252, reported by Santiago Vila.
  * Silenced non-standard-dir-in-usr check about /usr/$arch-linuxlibc1/,
    which will go away at some point and is not worth moving now.
    I'll file a policy proposal for it at some point.  This fixes
    bug#33114, reported by Marcus Brinkmann, and bug#33374, reported
    by James Troup
  * Silenced non-standard-dir-in-var check about /var/www/, since it's

      W: non-standard-dir-in-var
      W: file-in-unusual-dir

      E: binary-in-etc
      E: use-of-compat-symlink
      E: subdir-in-bin
    These cover much of the FSSTND and FHS.

  * No longer emit executable-in-usr-doc for scripts.  It's just too
    controversial.  I've added an info-level tag script-in-usr-doc
    for people who are interested.  This closes bug#28560, by
    Stephane Bortzmeyer.

  * Only emit compiled-with-bad-libc if the register_frame symbols
    are UNdefined.  This closes bug#31867, submitted by Michael Meskes.

  * Don't emit compiled-with-bad-libc for binaries linked to
    libgnustep_base.so.0, which also defines __register_frame_info.
    This closes bug#31004, submitted by Matthias Klose.

  * Changed a lot of "error:" messages to "internal error:", to make
    clear that they are errors in Lintian's execution, not in the package
    being checked.  This closes bug#31013, submitted by James Troup.

  * (frontend/lintian) Select STDOUT again after closing OUTPUT_PIPE.
    This fixes bug#31574, reported by Julian Gilbey.  Thanks for the patch!

  * (checks/copyright-file) Lintian was confused by "libident(=0.22-1)",
    i.e. without separating whitespace.  Fixed.  This closes bug#31821,
    reported by Paul Slootman.

  * Man page fix: mention that lintian can be run on .changes files.
  * Depcheck pages: fixed version comparison bug.

  * Do not abort when run as root; print a warning instead.
    --allow-root still overrides the warning.

  * Only generate non-standard-file-permissions-for-etc-init.d-script
    tag for regular files.  Reported by Martin Schulze.

  * Corrected libtool-workaround sample configure.in snippet:
    Look for *-*-linux-gnu, not *-pc-linux-gnu.
    Fixes bug#30756, reported by James Troup.

  * Made lintian abort with an error message when objdump can't handle
    a binary's file format.  Also made lintian Suggest binutils-multiarch.

  * New error tag: arch-dependent-file-in-usr-share
    This closes bug#30742, reported by Matthias Klose.

  * Added gnuplot as a known interpreter.  Suggestion by Rafael Laboissiere.

  * New features (summary):
    - 112 new spelling corrections.
    - Minor efficiency improvements.
    - Checks __register_frame_info problems.
    - Updated to policy 2.5.0

  * (lib/util.pl) Exit with code 2 when failing, like the manpage says.
  * (checks/files) Print octal permissions in
    bad-permissions-for-etc-cron.d-script, not decimal.
  * (checks/files)
    Ignore .xpm extensions too when hunting for extra license files.
  * (checks/conffiles, checks/conffiles.desc)
    Renamed -may-not-be- tags to -must-not-be-, for clarity.

  * Replaced most bash scripts with perl scripts, for faster startup times
    and fewer subprocesses.  This speeds up lintian by some 30% on my machine.
  * (collection/objdump-info)
    Add -T flag, to collect dynamic symbols table too.
  * (checks/binaries)
    Look for __register_frame_info and __unregister_frame_info.
    New tag: compiled-with-bad-libc

  * (checks/*.desc) Use new (2.5.0) section numbering for policy references.
  * (checks/changelog-file) Accept changelog.html.gz files.
  * (checks/standards-version) newer-standards-version is warning, not error.
    This fixes bug#29366, reported by Julian Gilbey <jdg@maths.qmw.ac.uk>.
  * (checks/standards-version) Updated to standards-version 2.5.0.

  * (info/overrides) New overrides.
    Fixes bug#29449 reported by Marcus Brinkmann (libc5 overrides)

  * (checks/standards-version.desc) Remove the link to the upgrading-checklist,
    which I can no longer find and which is probably not maintained anymore.

  * (checks/control-files) Fix check for mknod-in-maintainer script:
    pipes are made with p, not -p.

  * (debian/control) In the package description, mention which policy
    version Lintian checks.

lintian (0.9.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/binaries) Warn if a package with ELF binaries does not have
    a Depends line.  New tag: missing-depends-line.
    (Suggested by Charles Briscoe-Smith)

  * (checks/menus) Don't warn about /usr/lib/menu/README.
    (Noted by joost witteveen)

  * (checks/binaries.desc, checks/binaries, checks/shared-libs.desc)
    Renamed "shlib-without-dependency-information" to
    "shared-lib-without-dependency-information", to avoid confusion with
    the shlibs control file.  (Suggested by Branden Robinson)
    Also moved the tag info from shared-libs.desc to binaries.desc, where
    it belongs.

  * (checks/shared-libs)
    Suppress "shlib-with-executable-bit" error if a library has an
    INTERP header.  This catches the libraries (such as libc or libm)
    that print a little banner when executed.

  * (checks/fields)
    Report maintainer addresses that have no dots in the domain part.
    (Suggestion by James Troup)
  * Teach fields check about non-us.

  * (info/perl-modules)  Updated modules info.
  * (lib/deplib.pl)  Fixed handling of versioned dependencies.

  * (checks/files.desc)  In executable-in-usr-doc tag, suggest examples
    directory as a place for executables.
    (Suggestion by Stephane Bortzmeyer)

  * (checks/fields, checks/fields.desc)
    New tag: depends-on-obsolete-package, to flag dependencies on
    old libraries.

  * Look for more misspellings:
      dependant -> dependent, dependancy -> dependency,
      definate -> definite, definately -> definitely.
  * (checks/scripts) Correctly deal with the terminating newline when
    parsing dependency lines.  Fixed bug#27694, reported by Rob Tillotson.
  * (checks/menu-format) Added Apps/Technical and Apps/Hamradio as sections.
  * (checks/copyright-file)
    Don't report copyright-file-is-gpl unless it is GPL version 2.
    This fixes bug#27793, reported by Milan Zamazal.
  * (checks/menus) Add newline after bad-menu-file-name tag!
  * (lib/manual_refs.pl) Update urls to manual sections, so that
    they refer to www.debian.org.  Regenerate index of devref sections.

lintian (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * (frontend/lintian, reporting/html_reports, checks/*, collection/*)
    Make rigorous distinction between source and binary packages.
    Pass "source" or "binary" as second argument to check scripts.
    Report source package tags with "pkg source:" instead of just "pkg:".
    Binary package tags stay the same.
    (The check scripts always report "pkg type:", and the frontend strips
     the type again if it's "binary").
    This involves several changes in the web-report scripts as well.

  * Add command-line options for the things that could only be set via
    environment variables or the configuration file.  (--cfg, --root,
    --lab, --dist, --arch).

  * Really rename obsolete-ldconfig-call-in-postinst to
    postinst-has-useless-call-to-ldconfig.
  * Really rename changelog-file-missing-in-native-debian-package to
    changelog-file-missing-in-native-package

  * (checks/scripts) bltwish now lives in blt8.0, not blt4.2.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Sun, 20 Sep 1998 16:34:38 +0200

lintian (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/menu-format) Added "sort" as a known tag; it's documented in
    the menu package.  This fixes bug#26373, reported by Marcelo E. Magallon.

  * (checks/scripts, checks/scripts.desc)  Added /usr/bin/js as a known
    interpreter (in ngs-js), as suggested by Brian Bassett.

  * (checks/shared-libs)  Brian Bassett reported inaccuracies in detection
    of "ldconfig" calls in maintainer scripts.  Fixed.

  * (checks/menu-format)  Skip checks on "section" if the "needs" tag had an
    unknown value.  This deals with bug#26375, reported by Marcelo E. Magallon.

  * (checks/manpages)  Fixed: check for links to "undocumented" manpage
    should not react to link destinations like "ilu-undocumented".

  * changelog-file-missing-in-native-debian-package shortened to
    changelog-file-missing-in-native-package
  * wrong-name-for-changelog-file-of-native-debian-package shortened to

lintian (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ignore common programming-language extensions when looking for
    extra-license-files.  (Fixes bug#26252, reported by Manoj Srivastava,
    who had a file vm-license.el).

  * Use -z flag for tar, rather than piping through gzip -dc explicitly.
    This allows tar to detect and pass on errors reported by gzip.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Tue,  1 Sep 1998 11:57:53 +0200

lintian (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /usr/bin/guile and /usr/bin/scsh as known interpreters.
    (This fixes bug#26093, reported by Karl M. Hegbloom <karlheg@debian.org>)

  * Renamed tags:
       postinst-contains-obsolete-call-to-updatemenus
    to postinst-has-useless-call-to-update-menus
       postrm-contains-obsolete-call-to-updatemenus
    to postrm-has-useless-call-to-update-menus
       postinst-contains-obsolete-call-to-installdocs
    to postinst-has-useless-call-to-install-docs
       postrm-contains-obsolete-call-to-installdocs
    to postrm-has-useless-call-to-install-docs
       obsolete-ldconfig-call-in-postinst
    to postinst-has-useless-call-to-ldconfig
    The first two are also downgraded from error to warning.
    (This fixes bug#26118, reported by Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>)

  * Renamed tag use-of-killall-in-maintainer-script to killall-is-dangerous.

  * More overrides.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Thu, 27 Aug 1998 18:56:03 +0200

lintian (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/perl) Don't emit warnings for perl scripts in /usr/doc.
    This closed bug#25728, reported by Manoj Srivastava.

  * (info/overrides) Change the non-standard-*-perm overrides to match
    the new format of those tags.  (was changed in 0.7.5)

  * (checks/control-files)
    "possibly-insecure-handling-of-tmp-files-in-maintainer-script" now knows
    about mkdir.
    New tag: W: possible-bashism-in-maintainer-script (Suggestion by Joey Hess)

  * (testset/filenames-2)  Don't rely on installer's umask for testset.

  * (collection/menu-files, collection/menu-files.desc,
     checks/menu-format, checks/menu-format.desc)
    New check for correct syntax in "menu" files, written by Joey Hess.
    New tags:
      E: old-format-menu-file
      E: whitespace-after-continuation-character
      E: bad-test-in-menu-item
      E: unparsable-menu-item
      W: incorrect-package-test
      W: duplicated-tag-in-menu-item
      W: menu-item-missing-important-tag
      W: menu-item-contains-unknown-tag
      W: menu-item-uses-icon-none
      W: menu-item-needs-tag-has-unknown-value
      E: menu-item-adds-to-root-menu
      W: menu-item-uses-apps-games-section
      W: menu-item-creates-new-section
      E: menu-item-creates-new-root-section
    The check follows current practice on two sections:
      Window-managers -> WindowManagers
      Screen/Screen-saver -> Screen/Save
    The menu docs will be updated to match.

  * (lib/pipeline.pl) Bugfix: Use syscall SYS_exit when exiting from
    children that failed to exec, because the perl function exit() would
    run END blocks and such.

  * (checks/standards-version) By now, 2.2.0.0 is more than one year old;
    mark it as 'ancient'.

  * (reporting/html_reports) Bugfix: Apply quotehtml() to the tag text
    *before* adding links to bug pages.

  * Many small adjustments to checks:
  * (checks/scripts) Be less picky about package names when checking
    dependencies.  (The check was confused by the package blt4.2)
  * (checks/description) Ignore case when looking for synopsis lines
    that start with the package name.
  * (checks/files) Don't give executable-in-usr-doc error for executables
    in /usr/doc/examples/, since that directory does contain examples, and
    it's already flagged by old-style-example-dir.
  * (checks/control-files) Don't warn about references to "/tmp" unless the
    full filename is "/tmp" or "/var/tmp".
  * (checks/binaries) Split tag "binary-not-linked-against-libc" into
    "program" and "library" tags.
  * (checks/files, checks/scripts) New tag "executable-manpage", which
    replaces "executable-not-elf-or-script" for manpages.
  * (checks/files) Shortened file-directly-in-usr-share-not-in-a-sub-directory
    and file-directly-in-usr-doc-not-in-a-sub-directory to just
    file-directly-in-usr-share and file-directly-in-usr-doc.
  * (checks/md5sums) Added md5sums-control-file-is-empty tag, to avoid
    spewing many file-missing-in-md5sums errors in that case.
  * (checks/scripts) Suppress interpreter-not-absolute tag if the
    filename ends in .in and the interpreter looks like #!@PERL@
  * (checks/control-files) Suppress mknod-in-maintainer-script tag if
    mknod was called with -p.
  * (checks/shared-libs) Emit no-shlibs-control-file tag for each shared lib
    found, rather than just once.
  * (checks/files) Emit old-style-example-dir only for directories, not for
    every file.
  * (checks/perl) perl-script-needs-dependency
    Bugfix: realize that a package does not need to depend on itself.
  * (checks/description) possible-unindented-list-in-extended-description:
    Only emit this tag if there are at least two things that look like
    list items.
  * (checks/scripts) List /usr/bin/env as a known interpreter.
  * (checks/binaries) unstripped-binary-or-object:
    Instead of an exception for /lib/modules specifically, suppress this
    tag for all .o files.
  * (checks/control-files) Bugfix: check for == bashism works now.
  * (checks/files) Introduced new tag lengthy-symlink, which supersedes
    and corrects the relative-symlink-enters-same-toplevel-directory tag.

  * (man/lintian.1) Document the check and collection scripts added to
    lintian in the last few months. (oops)

  * (collection/perlmods, checks/perl)
    Refined scanner so that fewer spurious perl-script-uses-unknown-module
    tags are emitted.
    Perl tags are no longer 'Experimental'.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Mon, 24 Aug 1998 18:01:40 +0200

lintian (0.7.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/perl) Exchanged order of arguments in
    perl-script-needs-dependency tag, for clarity.
  * (info/perl-modules) Added some module dependencies.

  * (info/overrides) More overrides.

  * (checks/shared-libs, checks/shared-libs.desc)
    Fixed: erroneous shlib-missing-in-control-file if a shared library
    had more than one symlink to it.
  * Renamed obsolete-shlib-entry-in-control-file to
    unused-shlib-entry-in-control-file.

  * (checks/copyright-file) Changed size-requirement for copyright-file-is-gpl
    tag from 17000 to 12000 bytes, because some packages (casio) extracted
    only the "TERMS AND CONDITIONS" part, which is shorter.

  * (reporting/html_reports) Count packages as well as tags, in tag index.

  * (checks/control-files, checks/control-files.desc)
    New tag: W: mknod-in-maintainer-script

  * (checks/files, checks/files.desc)
    New tags:
       W: package-installs-into-etc-rc.boot   (rc.boot is obsolete)
       W: extra-license-file                  (for COPYING files, etc)

  * (checks/shared-libs, frontend/lintian)
    Get rid of dependency on File::Basename; use a simple regexp instead.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Fri, 14 Aug 1998 17:33:37 +0200

lintian (0.7.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * (collection/perlmods)
    Fixed: perl script scanner is now POD-aware.
    This should cut down on the number of spurious warnings.

  * (doc/CREDITS)
    Install credits file.  My apologies if I have forgotten anyone.
    There were far more people than I would have guessed -- Thanks to all! :-)

  * (checks/perl)
    Skip 'autouse' keyword when parsing use and require directives.

  * (frontend/lintian)
    When processing a .changes file, turn md5sum checks OFF by default.
    A new -m flag is provided to turn them back on.
    The .dsc file is still always checked.

  * (frontend/lintian)
    Saner interrupt handling.  Lintian now dies immediately if ^C is hit,
    and does remove the temporary lab (if any).  This is mostly a side
    effect of avoiding system() (in favour of the new functions in
    lib/pipeline.pl), but did involve some tinkering about with perl's
    signal handling.  Thanks to Ruud de Rooij and Graydon Hoare for
    their help.  This closes bug#24975, reported by Yann Dirson.

  * (checks/copyright)
    Fixed copyright-is-gpl tag so that it actually works.

  * (lib/dep.pl, checks/perl, checks/perl.desc, info/perl-modules)
    Much smarter perl module analysis.  Lintian now has a list of
    perl modules and the packages that provide them (in info/perl-modules),
    and a dependency processor (in lib/dep.pl), and uses these to
    check "use" and "require" lines in perl scripts.
    New tags:
      W: perl-script-needs-dependency  (Experimental)
      W: perl-script-uses-unknown-module  (Experimental)
    Tag "script-needs-full-perl" has been dropped.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Mon, 10 Aug 1998 19:02:53 +0200

lintian (0.7.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * (frontend/lintian)
    Fixed: --display-infotags option wasn't working.

  * (reporting/harness, reporting/html_reports)
    Have the archive check generate infotags but not display them on the
    web pages.  This way they are still available in the log file.

  * (checks/fields, checks/fields.desc)
    New tag: W: doc-package-depends-on-main-package

  * (checks/menus, checks/menus.desc)
    New tag: E: bad-menu-file-name
    This is emitted for packages that install "/usr/lib/menu/menu", which
    overlaps with the menu package.  (I've seen it happen a couple of times).

  * (checks/binaries, checks/binaries.desc)
    Allow unstripped-binary-or-object for any package with "debug" in its
    name.  (This is in addition to the exeption already made for "-dbg").
    Allow binary-not-linked-against-libc for libc itself :-)

  * (lib/pipeline.pl)
    New helper functions for starting pipelines from perl scripts, without
    involving the shell.  This makes it easier to pass filenames literally,
    and often saves a shell invocation.
  * (collection/diffstat, frontend/lintian, unpack/*)
    Use the new pipeline functions.

  * (checks/description, checks/description.desc)
    New tag:
      E: description-is-debmake-template

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    Quote < and > in displayed tags (such as occurs in email addresses).
    This fixes the maintainer-name-missing tag output.

  * (checks/copyright-file, checks/copyright-file.desc)
    New tag:
      E: copyright-file-is-gpl
    Generated for copyright files that contain the complete GPL text.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Thu,  6 Aug 1998 23:39:18 +0200

lintian (0.7.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * (unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l1, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l2)
    Speedup: replaced system("mkdir ...") with mkdir() calls.
  * (unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1)
    Speedup: avoid extracting control info twice.
    More speedups are possible here.
  * (unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l2)
    Speedup: avoid using dpkg-deb to unpack debs; construct a pipeline
    with ar, gzip, and tar instead.  It turns out to be far faster.
  * Together, these changes made for a speed increase of some 30%
    when checking packages that have to be unpacked.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Wed,  5 Aug 1998 19:18:44 +0200

lintian (0.7.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    Fixed: Print bug number with tags that were reported as bugs.

  * (checks/scripts, checks/scripts.desc)
    Added /usr/bin/expect (provided by expect) as known interpreter.

  * (unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l2)
    Fixed: chmod -R the right directory when unpacking a source package.

  * (collection/diffstat, collection/diffstat.desc)
    New collection script that runs diffstat on the Debian diff.
  * (debian/control)
    Depend on diffstat, version >= 1.27-1 so that it can parse Debian diffs.
  * (checks/debdiff, checks/debdiff.desc)
    New check that look at the filenames included in the Debian diff.
    New tag:
      W: patch-failure-file-in-diff foo.rej

  * (checks/control-files, checks/control-files.desc)
    New tag:
      W: dpkg-print-architecture-in-maintainer-script
    (dpkg --print-installation-architecture should be used there)

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Wed,  5 Aug 1998 14:58:02 +0200

lintian (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    - Rewritten (more modular).
    - Create a page for each different tag, which gives the lintian-info
      for that tag and then lists all occurrences of that tag, with each
      tag line also being a link back to the page for the package in
      which it occurs.
      This closes bug#21390, reported by Gregory S. Stark <gsstark@mit.edu>.
    - Instead of listing the lintian-info text with every different tag
      in every package, make every tag a link to the page for that tag
      (which will have the lintian-info for it at the top).
      This should make the reports a lot smaller, and also more readable.
    - Make a "Sorted by tag types" page and link to it from the index page.
  * (doc/TODO) Entries [L3] and [L4] now complete.

  * (checks/spelling, checks/spelling.desc)
    Check README.Debian file as well, since we now collect it anyway
    for the readme-debian-is-debmake-template tag.
    New tag:
       E: spelling-error-in-readme-debian

  * (checks/fields) Added hurd-i386 to the list of known architectures, at
    the request of Marcus Brinkmann <brinkmds@rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de>.

  * (checks/scripts, checks/scripts.desc)
    Added trs to the list of known interpreters, as /usr/bin/trs provided
    by konwert.  Suggestion by Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>.  This
    closed bug#24998.

  * (checks/files)
    - Fixed: tags dir-in-user-local and file-in-usr-local did not print
      the filename involved.
    - Fixed: some tags were erroneously output as "setuid-gid-binary"
      even though only one of suid or sgid was set.

  * (checks/fields)
    - Fixed: change a few cases of "maintainer-address-malformed"
      to "maintainer-name-missing".

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Tue,  4 Aug 1998 19:45:47 +0200

lintian (0.6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Inserted GPL boilerplate text in every file whose format allowed comments.

  * (doc/lintian.sgml) Use new <url> tag.

  * (info/overrides) New override for the file in kbd-data with the strange
    name.  Having lintian handle that file correctly would be too expensive.
    This "closes" bug#25107.

  * (checks/control-files, checks/control-files.desc)
    New tag: use-of-killall-in-maintainer-script (experimental)
    Added at the recommendation of Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es>.
    This closes bug#22206.

  * (depcheck/deppages.pl, reporting/html_reports)
    Added arm and hurd-i386 to the list of architectures to check.

  * (doc/libtool-rpath-workaround.txt, checks/binaries.desc)
    Revamped doc file at Rob Browning's suggestion, and renamed it to
    doc/libtool-workarounds.txt because it describes both -rpath and -lc
    workarounds.  Updated the info for the tags binary-not-linked-against-libc
    and binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath to refer to the new file.

  * (doc/desc-files)  Moved from private/DESC.
    Briefly describes the meanings of the fields used in lintian's .desc files.

  * (doc/TODO)
    Updated and restructured version of what used to be in private/TODO,
    various bugreports and mailed suggestions.  This will become the
    central place for potential improvements to lintian.  I hope that
    having it in /usr/doc/lintian will inspire some people to help.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Mon,  3 Aug 1998 16:07:54 +0200

lintian (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/shared-libs)
    Corrected bug that made lintian complain about shared modules without
    version info (thus ending in ".so") with a "non-dev-pkg-with-shlib-symlink"
    warning.

  * (info/overrides)  Added overrides:
    libtricks is like fakeroot; nothing is compiled with it.
      libtricks: no-shlibs-control-file
    slrnpull has been split off from slrn, and shares some of its overrides.
      slrnpull: non-standard-dir-perm var/spool/slrnpull/ 2755
      This fixes bug#24668, reported by Joey Hess.

  * (collection/perlmods)
    Collector script that greps perl scripts for use and require directives.
  * (checks/perl, checks/perl.desc)
    New check script that checks perl "use" and "require" directives.
    New tags:
       E: script-needs-perl-version   (Experimental)
       W: script-needs-full-perl      (Experimental)
       I: cannot-parse-perl-directive

  * (frontend/lintian)
    New flag --print-version that prints the unadorned version number.
  * (reporting/config, reporting/html_reports)
    Instead of requiring $LINTIAN_VERSION in the config file, query the
    lintian frontend for the version number.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Sun, 19 Jul 1998 16:41:39 +0200

lintian (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    Lintian web pages now use dists/unstable/main in the path for
    "Getting Lintian", rather than hamm/hamm, where it doesn't exist anymore.
    (Pointed out by Ruud de Rooij)

  * (checks/scripts)
    Add /usr/sbin/install-fvwmgenmenu as a known interpreter.
    This fixes bug#23783, reported by Joost Kooij.

  * (checks/binaries, checks/changelog-file, checks/manpages)
    [speedup] Don't skip blank lines in file-info file, since there
    shouldn't be any.

  * (checks/manpages.desc)
    - Added note to manpage-in-wrong-directory info that only
      sections 1 through 9 should be used.  Refer to policy 5.1.
    I had a rewrite of the manpages check in the works, but I deferred
    it to a later lintian version.

  * (info/overrides)
    New override from Joel Klecker: binutils: no-shlibs-control-file.
    Added overrides supplied by Joey Hess, in bugreport #24425.

  * (checks/changelog-file)
    Corrected regexp used for changelog-file-not-compressed;
    This really fixes bug#23683, reported by Joey Hess.

  * (checks/files)
    New warning: package-installs-perllocal-pod, inspired by
    Manoj Srivasta's recent bugreports about such files.

  * (checks/fields.desc)
    No longer experimental:
      E: alternates-not-allowed
      E: versioned-provides
      E: bad-version-in-relation

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Sun, 12 Jul 1998 22:04:04 +0200

lintian (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added overrides supplied by Ray Dassen.

  * (frontend/lintian-info)
    Made lintian-info aware of X (experimental) tags.  (oops)
  * (lib/read_taginfo.pl)
    Add a paragraph to the info output for experimental tags that explains
    what experimental status means.

  * Added test package "relationships" to test weird dependency lines.

  * (frontend/lintian)
    Instead of specifying /usr/bin/lintian-info, use just lintian-info
    and let the path search find the script.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Tue,  7 Jul 1998 16:27:56 +0200

lintian (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/menus) The menu package doesn't need to check for the
    existence of update-menus :-)

  * (testset/runtests) A harness for running regression tests on Lintian.
  * (testset/*) A collection of broken packages on which to test Lintian.
    Currently, only an empty package is provided for testing.
  * (debian/rules) Run the tests in the build target.
  * (checks/*.desc) Added "Tested: empty" to tags that are tested for
    with the "empty" testpackage.

  * (collection/file-info) Use a better parser for the index file, so
    that weird filenames are handled correctly.  This fixes bug#24079.
  * (collection/md5sums) Adapt index-file parser from file-info collector,
    this saves a "find" operation on the unpacked tree.
  * New test package filenames-1, which contains various evil filenames.

  * (checks/shared-libs, checks/menus, checks/manpages, checks/files,
     checks/control-files)
    Handle filenames that contain spaces correctly.

  * (frontend/lintian, reporting/config)
    Update version number.  This fixes bug #23555, reported by Yann Dirson.
    These will have to be kept in sync manually, because the lintian
    source package has to be directly usable by the lintian web page
    generator.

  * (checks/changelog-file)
    Allow the upstream changelog to be a symbolic link.
    As a side-effect, allow it for the Debian changelog too.
    This handles bug#23300, reported by Manoj Srivastava.

  * (checks/changelog-file, checks/changelog-file.desc)
    The wrong-name tags are now warnings, not errors, because the
    relevant section of policy uses "should usually".
    This fixes bug#23757, reported by Gregory S. Stark.

  * (checks/changelog-file)
    Limited the changelog-file-not-compressed tag to only complain
    about changelog and changelog.Debian, because policy 5.8 does not
    mention other changelogs.  (These would fall under section 5.3, I guess.)
    This fixes bug#23683, reported by Joey Hess.

lintian (0.4.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/fields)
    New error tag: "multiline-field" flags control fields that span multiple
    lines when they shouldn't.  (According to the Packaging manual,
    "Except where otherwise stated only a single line of data is allowed").

  * (checks/fields)
    Check dependency relationship fields as well.
    New tags:
      E: alternates-not-allowed
           (generated for use of | in Provides, Conflicts, and Replaces fields)
      E: versioned-provides
           (generated for Provides fields that use a versioned package name)
      W: obsolete-relation-form
           (generated for use of < and > in versioned relationships)
      W: bad-version-in-relation
           (generated if the version number in a versioned relation
            is not syntactically correct)
      E: bad-relation
           (generated if lintian cannot parse an element of a dependency line)
      W: package-relation-with-self

  * (checks/fields)
    Bugfix to maintainer-not-full-name tag, it works now.
    Added maintainer-address-looks-weird warning for obscure cases.
    I doubt anyone will ever see it.

  * (checks/fields)
    Added new-essential-package warning, to highlight such packages.

  * (checks/fields.desc) Descriptions of new tags.

    problems.

  * (checks/menus) Distinguish between install-docs and install-docs -r.
    (closes #23049).

  * (checks/files) Added new tag backup-file-in-package.  This warns
    about emacs-style backup files that got installed in a package.

  * (frontend/lintian) Allow I: tags to be overridden just like any other.

  * (frontend/lintian) Add support for "Experimental" tags.  These are
    handled like other tags, but an "Experimental: yes" flag in the tag
    description tells lintian to output them with "X:" rather than "E:"
    or "W:" or "I:".  This is used for new tags that might still misbehave.

  * (doc/lintian.sgml) Add a paragraph to explain the new tag type.
    "The displayed message is one of types listed above, but has been
     flagged as `experimental' by the Lintian maintainers.  This means
     that the code that generates this message is not as well tested as
     the rest of Lintian, and might still give surprising results.  Feel
     free to ignore Experimental messages that do not seem to make sense,
     though of course bug reports are always welcomed."

lintian (0.4.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * (debian/control)
    Lintian now depends on perl, since perl-base is not enough. It already
    uses Text::Wrap, which is only in perl, and soon it will also use
    Getopt::Long.

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    Report all dates in GMT, in rfc822 format.

  * (debian/rules)
    In clean target, delete byte-compiled python files (*.pyc) as well.

  * (depcheck/dependencies.py)
    Check "Cannot satisfy without packages in base" before checking
    "Cannot satisfy with required packages", because a dependency will
    be listed in only one category, and the former is more important
    to flag.

  * (frontent/lintian)
    Rewrote option handling to use Getopt::Long, thus allowing nifty
    features like bundling of single-character options.  Closes wishlist
    bug#22566.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Fri, 29 May 1998 11:25:31 +0200

lintian (0.4.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * (depcheck/) New directory, containing scripts for generating reports
    about broken dependency relationships in the main distribution.
    These are not installed by the lintian deb, they are intended for
    use by the lintian web pages, which use the source package directly.
  * (reports/harness) Added hooks to call the depcheck scripts to generate
    the depcheck page.
  * (reports/html_reports) Add links from the lintian root page to the
    depcheck page.

  * (checks/menus) A tag was still generating "existance" while its
    description had been corrected to "existence"; the html report
    generator complained about that.  Fixed.

  * (unpack/list-binpkg) Bugfix in lintian --setup-lab.  Instead of
    looking for files in binary-$arch and binary-all, look only in
    binary-$arch and follow the symlinks.

  * (lib/text_utils.pl) Changed "&maint;" name from Christian Schwarz
    to Richard Braakman, and changed mail address to lintian-maint@debian.org.

  * (checks/standards-version) If checking a package with a Standards-Version
    that is newer than the one lintian is written for, warn that lintian
    should be upgraded.  (closes: #22919).
  * (checks/standards-version.dsc)
    New tag: newer-standards-version

  * (checks/debian-readme) New check: at James Troup's suggestion,
    scan for unmodified deb-make templates in README.Debian files.
    New tags:
      readme-debian-is-debmake-template
      readme-debian-contains-debmake-template
  * (checks/debian-readme.desc) Describe new tags.
  * (collection/debian-readme) New collection script for README.Debian file.
  * (man/lintian.1) Describe new check and collection script.

  * (doc/libtool-rpath-workaround.txt) Explain how to achieve the same
    result without touching configure.in and rerunning autoconf, provided
    certain conditions hold.

  * (lib/text_utils.pl, frontend/lintian-info, reporting/html_reports)
    Do not split words that are longer than a line.  This fixes the
    "Poli cy" bug in the lintian HTML reports.

  * (checks/standards-version.desc) Corrected the URL to Christian's
    policy upgrading checklist, which seems to have changed from
    "upgrading.html" to "upgrading-checklist.html".

  * (info/override) Removed another *.pm warning, I missed it the last time.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Thu, 28 May 1998 15:51:37 +0200

lintian (0.4.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/scripts) Suppress script-not-executable warnings for files
    in /usr/lib that match *.pm.  These are perl modules, which often
    have a #!/usr/bin/perl line at the top but are not intended to be
    executed directly.
  * (info/override) Removed now-suppressed warnings from the overrides file.

  * (info/override) Added more overrides.  (closes #21028).

  * (checks/scripts) At Oliver Elphick's suggestion, do not emit
    *-script-but-no-*-dep tags or csh-considered-harmful tags for
    scripts that are not executable.  (These already produce a
    script-not-executable warning).

  * (checks/binaries) At Yann Dirson's suggestion, added a tag for
    stripped binaries that still have the .comment and .note sections.
    This tag is info-level, thus not normally displayed.
    dh_strip and install -s have been patched to strip these sections,
    but most of the distribution has not been recompiled with the patched
    versions.
  * (checks/binaries.desc) Described the new tag.
    (closes #22495).

  * (man/lintian.1) Documented the options that were added in lintian 0.4.3.

  * (checks/fields) Produce informational tags no-section-field and
    no-priority-field.  These were removed in a previous version, because
    nearly all packages do not pass -isp to dpkg-gencontrol when building
    packages, but the new handling of info-level tags makes them useful again.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Sat, 16 May 1998 14:10:30 +0200

lintian (0.4.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Christian added more overrides.
  * debian/control: New maintainer.
  * debian/copyright: Mention that lintian has no separate upstream source.
  * debian/rules: Got rid of 'dirs' file.
  * Moved manpages from doc/ to man/ in source package.
  * debian/rules: Restyled :-)
  * New overrides, read all about them in /usr/share/lintian/info/overrides.
    (closes #22001)
  * Corrected typo in frontend, added --allow-root option at Johnie Ingram's
    suggestion to override lintian's refusal to run as root.  (closes #22162).
  * Ran ispell over .desc files, fixing lots of typos, including the
    word "existance" which occurs in several tags.
  * checks/files: At the advice of the python maintainer, added a warning
    against files installed in /usr/lib/python1.5 that are not in the
    site-packages subdirectory.  (closes #22236)
  * checks/fields: Reduced unknown-field-in-dsc and unknown-field-in-control
    tags from "warning" to "info", because such fields can only be
    introduced deliberately anyway.  ("info" tags are not normally reported,
    but can be queried when someone is interested.)  (closes #20521)
  * Made the above comment about info tags true, by adding a --display-info
    option.

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Apr 1998 21:42:51 +0200

lintian (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changes which make it possible to check the whole archive with Lintian
    each day without having to check all packages all the time:
    - Reworked creation and handling of info/{binary,source}-packages files:
      - the list files contain a version number now, which allows checking
        for old file formats
      - each entry has a timestamp now
      - don't remove $LAB/info/ directory on --setup-lab
      - just process changed packages when doing --setup-lab
    - added command line option: `-p X' makes lintian only process all
      packages which are listed in file X
    - changed meaning of command line option `-U': specifies info to
      collect _in addition to_ the usual info (necessary to extract
      the changelog files on master--see below)

  * Improved `binaries' check:
    - objects and binaries in a *-dbg package may be unstripped
    - libraries in lib/profile or lib/debug may not be stripped
      (suggested by Fabrizio)
    [1 new tag]

  * Added new `changelog' check

  * Improved `description' check:
    - fixed RE to check for description-starts-with-package-name
      (thanks to Roderick Schertler)

  * Fixed `fields' check:
    - internal: check for source pkg using "-l dsc" instead of "-e dsc"

  * Fixed `files' check:
    - disabled possible-name-space-pollution tag since policy is not
      defined yet

  * Improved `manpages' check:
    - fixed silly typo in binary-without-manpage tag info
      (thanks to Robert Edmonds for noticing that!)
    - disabled tag binary-without-manpage for `versioned binaries'
      (thanks to Dirk for the suggestion! fixes:bug#20186)

  * Fixed `menu' check:
    - report maintainer-script-does-not-check... tag only once per package
      and maintainer script
    - recognize `$(which update-menus)' as valid check for the existance
      of update-menus; same for install-docs
      (thanks to Fabrizio for pointing this out!)
    - recognize `command -v update-menus' as valid check for the existance
      of update-menus; same for install-docs
      (thanks to Adam P. Harris for pointing this out! fixes:bug#20759)
    - fixed tag infos
      (thanks to Adam P. Harris for the input! fixes:bug#19810)

    [1 new tag]

  * Added `changelog' collector script
    This makes it possible for Lintian to extract all changelog files
    on master for use by Apt (fixes:bug#20546)

  * Incremented LAB_FORMAT version to 3 because of
    incompatible changes in the objdump-info collector script

  * Internal: fixed bug in read_dpkg_control() utility function: empty
    tags have not been handled correctly

        bad-owner-for-doc-file
        dir-or-file-in-opt

  * Added overrides

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Mar 1998 08:44:34 +0100

lintian (0.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is (intentionally) an `unstable' upload--we've decided to not
    include the lintian package in `frozen' since it doesn't make sense to
    maintain a `stable' and `unstable' version of a package in such an
    early state. The maintainers should get Lintian from the `unstable'
    distribution to check `frozen' uploads though.

  * Added `menus' check. This check checks for common mistakes WRT
    /usr/lib/menu and /usr/share/doc-base files.
    [16 new tags]

  * Fixed `shared-libs' check:
    - removed `shared-library-uses-its-soname' check since this produced
      way too many false alarms (thanks to David Engel for the input!)

  * Fixed `binaries' check:
    - skip `unstripped-binary-or-object' check for kernel modules
      (thanks to Michael Meskes for noticing that!)
    - fixed pattern which parses the `file' command's output to be able
      to handle files without info text correctly
      (thanks to James R. Van Zandt for pointing this out!)
    - mention in tag info that shared libs should be stripped with
      `--strip-unneeded' options (thanks to Brian for pointing this out!)

  * Improved `manpages' check:
    - check if manual pages are compressed with gzip -9
      (thanks to Holger Rusch for the idea!)
      [2 new tags]

  * Improved `files' check:
    - for files in /usr/doc:
      - executables may only be in /usr/doc/<something>/examples
      - files should be owned by root.root (thanks to Joey)
      - files should not be directly placed into /usr/doc/
  	(fixes:bug#19485)
    - no files may be installed into /tmp and /var/tmp
    - renamed file-directly-in-usr-share to
      file-directly-in-usr-share-not-in-a-sub-directory
      (thanks to Santiago)
    - fix tag info for "symlink-should-be-absolute"
    [3 new tags]

  * Improved `description' check:
    - lists (starting with a dash or asterisk) have to be indented
      (thanks to cpb4@ukc.ac.uk for the idea and the patch!
      fixes:bug#19481)
    [1 new tag]

  * Fixed `scripts' check:
    - packages with python scripts might depend on python or python-base
      (thanks to Gregor Hoffleit for pointing this out and to Richard for
      the patch! fixes:bug#19162)
    - remove wrong policy quotation for `script-not-executable' tag

  * Fixed `init.d' check:
    - ignore update-rc.d calls in preinst and postinst scripts, if
      "remove" option is specified (thanks to Roman Hodek and Herbert Xu
      for pointing this out--this change also removes a lot of other false
      alarms WRT update-rc.d calls)

  * Improved `control-files' check:
    - scan maintainer scripts for references to /tmp or TMPFILE since this
      might be insecure (thanks to Topi Miettinen for the help!)
    [1 new tag]

  * Improved `copyright-file' to issue a special error message if a
    symbolic link /usr/doc/foo refers to a directory outside of /usr/doc
    (thanks to Darren for pointing this out!)
    [1 new tag]

  * Fixed `fields' check:
    - added architecture `arm' (thanks to Roman Hodek)

  * Fixed `lintian' frontend:
    - run lintian scripts with LC_ALL=C
      (thanks to Yann for pointing this out! fixes:bug#19166)
    - changed handling of `#' comments: for comments in the overrides
      file, the hash (#) has to be in the first column
    - changed all tags which used `#' for comments

  * Fixed `lintian-info':
    - multiple HTML tags haven't been converted into text format in all
      cases
    - preformatted text is now handled correctly
    - merged with code that produced the HTML reports
    - code much cleaner now

  * Improved Lintian's documentation:
    - fixed libtool/rpath workaround file: don't wrap long line
      (Thanks to Yann for pointing this out!)
    - stress in docs that the "lintian-maint@debian.org" address should
      be used to contact the lintian authors (thanks to Adrian Bridgett
      for pointing this out!)

  * Added more overrides (fixes:bug#19163)

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Mar 1998 23:00:31 +0100

lintian (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added `scripts' checks and collector, written by Richard. This check
    checks the #! lines of scripts in a package.
    [40 new tags]

  * Added `spelling' checks, written by Richard. This check searches
    the "Description:" field and the "copyright" file for common spelling
    errors (typos).
    [2 new tags]

  * Improved `files' check: No package should install files directly into
    /usr/share.
    New tag:
      file-directly-in-usr-share

  * Fixed `files' check WRT files in /usr/lib/sgml and
    /etc/emacs/site-start.d:
      -	ignore directories and symbolic links when checking for correct
        file permissions
      - display permissions in octal format
    (fixes:bug#18866,#19026)

  * Fixed `control-files' check: really ignore `control' control file

  * Improved `lintian' frontend:
      - parse command line parameters before reading the configuration
        file. With that, `lintian -h' even works if the cfg file has
        errors.  (fixes:bug#19031)
      - issue a warning and ignore `-all' option if packages are specified
        at the same time (in older versions, this make lintian abort with
        an error message)
      - really check all packages listed in a .changes file
        (fixes:bug#18851)

  * Fixed `md5sums' check to handle file names with spaces correctly

  * Put conffile /etc/lintianrc back in (fixes:bug#19031)

  * Include information about libtool/rpath workaround by Yann Dirson
    (Thanks Yann!)

  * Added more overrides

  * Internal changes:
      - Each error tag has a (bug) `Severity' field now which can be used
        to file bug reports with the correct severity
      - Each helper script has an `Author' field now
      - Fixed `unused overrides' report

lintian (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lintian now also works without a configuration file and without
    a static laboratory!  (Since Lintian is so easy to use now, there
    are no excuses for not using it! ;-)

  * Changed handling of lab:
      - if no lab is specified, it is created dynamically by the
        `lintian' command (the average use does not have to worry
        about the lab anymore)
      - since the dynamically created lab is placed in /tmp, several
        users can run lintian at the same time without having to know
        of each other
      - the commands `lintian-setup' and `lintian-remove' have been
        removed (fixes: bug#18707).
      - a `static' laboratory can be created/updated or removed by
        specifying the `--setup-lab' or `--remove-lab' options for the
        `lintian' command
      - added a lot of sanity checks to make removal of lab less risky :)

  * Changed handling of configuration file:
      - configuration file is not necessary anymore
      - changed search path for the configuration file to:
          $LINTIAN_CFG/lintianrc
          $LINTIAN_ROOT/lintianrc
          $HOME/.lintianrc
          /etc/lintianrc
      - all configuration variables have reasonable defaults and can
        be overwritten by environment variables of the same name
      - removed configuration file /etc/lintianrc--the file is now
        installed as /usr/doc/lintian/lintianrc.example
      - renamed all configuration variables to LINTIAN_xxxx
      - relaxed syntax of configuration file. It's now also possible
        to use `~' and `$HOME' in the configuration file (fixes:
        bug#18559)
      - added LINTIAN_ARCH configuration variable so that Lintian
        handles distribution directories correctly if these contain
        several architectures

  * Changed parsing of command line arguments:
      - if a package name is specified (instead of a file), look for
        this package in the distribution directory and in the lab (in
        earlier version, only the distribution directory was searched
        for packages)
      - added `--all' option to check the whole distribution
        (in earlier version, this was the default operation)
      - removed buggy `-n' command line option (this option wasn't
        really useful anyways)
      - the `-h' option displays a short description of all available
        options now
      - debug option `-d' can be specified several times to increase
        the verbosity level
      - recognize `--' as the end of options on the command line

  * Improved overrides handling:
      - the override files does not include the leading `[EW]:'
        anymore
      - the parameters of an error tag may be omitted to disable
        a certain tag for a whole package
      - when checking the full distribution, unused overrides are
        displayed
      - cleaned up overrides file and added/removed a few overrides

  * Improved documentation:
      - there is now a `Lintian User's Manual' which explains how to
        setup and use Lintian to check ones packages, and which gives
        insight on the design issues behind Lintian
      - added a manual page for lintian-info (has been split off
        from lintian(1))
      - updated the documentation files and the example lintianrc file
      - merged QUICKSTART file into the README

  * Improved `binaries' check: check if a binary or shared library
    defines RPATH
    (Thanks to Ray Dassen for the suggestion! fixes: bug#18519)
    New tag:
      binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath

  * Improved `files' check:
     WRT symbolic links:
      - issue errors instead of warnings
      - links between different top-level directories should always be
        absolute
      - check for relative links which contain to many `../' segments
      - check for symbolic links which contain segments like `foo/../bar'
        (Thanks to Manoj for the patch and the ideas!)
     general:
      - some additional checks for wrong file permissions
    New tags:
      symlink-has-too-many-up-segments
      relative-symlink-enters-same-toplevel-directory

      bad-permissions-for-etc-cron.d-script (renamed)
      bad-permissions-for-etc-emacs-script
      executable-in-usr-lib-sgml

  * Fixed `control-files' check: check file permissions correctly;
    also check file owners of control files
    New tag:
      control-file-has-bad-owner

  * Fixed `copyright' check: check for package dependencies correctly
    (fixes: bug#18611)

  * Improved `conffiles' check: files in /var/lib/games should not be
    tagged as conffile, in general.
    New tag:
      score-file-may-not-be-conffile

  * Improved `manpages' check: files in /usr/X11R6/man/man6 usually
    indicate X11 games in the wrong directory.
    New tag:
      x11-games-should-be-in-usr-games

  * Fixed `init.d' check: skip comments in init.d file
    (Thanks to Joey for pointing this out!)

      - don't collect info for unselected collector scripts (internal bug)

  * Internal changes:
      - don't refer to package `ftp.debian.org' for bugs in the
        $LINTIAN_DIST directory--refer to package `general' instead
      - made list-binpkg and list-srcpkg more verbose
      - made lintian-info less verbose (don't give detailed info more
        than once)
      - create control-index file which lists all files in control.tar.gz
      - fix permissions in the lab after a package has been unpacked
      - chdir to lab dir before running the checker and collection
        scripts (this makes it easier to write checks in awk or even sh)
      - pass vars to helpers via environment
      - don't link static info/* files into lab
      - implemented dpkg_read_control to parse all controls
      - don't use dpkg-deb to get control information about a .deb
      - collection and checking scripts `registry' is now done dynamically
      - move tag descriptions from collector and checker scripts into
        separate `.desc' files
      - each base directory in the lab has a .lintian-status file now, which
        can be used to detect incompatible lab changes, for example
      - moved unused files and internal documents into a private/ directory
        of the source package
      - cleaned up code

lintian (0.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added `fields' check for control fields. (That's the first check
    written by Richard--and it's all Perl!!! ;-)
    [32 new tags]

  * Added `binaries' check.
    [6 new tags]

  * Improved `shared-libraries' check:
      - use objdump instead of ldd and ldconfig
      - this should fix all problems where Lintian couldn't check
        python/perl dynamic objects, etc.
      - allow cross-checking of packages, e.g., to check non-i386 .debs
        on a i386 system (note, that this requires a multi-arch objdump)
      - recognize if the shared library uses its SONAME
    New tag:
      shared-library-uses-its-soname

  * Improved `control-files' check:
      - Don't check the `control' control file for correct
        permissions, because dpkg doesn't care and this file isn't
        installed on the systems anyways

  * Improved `files' check:
      - Games are allowed to be setgid games
      - svgalib programs are allowed to be setuid root
      - usually, files in /usr/doc/foo should not be executable
    New tag:
      executable-in-usr-doc

  * Fix bug in `manpages' check: symlinks in /usr/bin, etc. also need
    a manual page! (Thanks to Joey Hess for pointing this out!)

  * Use `.' instead of `source' in lintian-{remove,setup} /bin/sh scripts
    (fixes bug#18421)

  * Define default values for configuration variables in
    lintian-{remove,setup} scripts (fixes bug#18354)

  * Fix bug in `copyright-file' check: Don't report
    usr-doc-symlink-to-foreign-package if we don't know whether the
    referenced package comes from the same source or not.
    (Thanks to James A. Treacy for pointing this out!)

  * Internal change:
      - process source packages before binary packages so that a binary
        package check can use info from the source packages (if these
        are unpacked, too)

  * Added more override entries--and removed a few obsolete entries
    (the checks are smarter now! :)

  * Added "Depends: binutils" for `objdump'

  * Changed maintainer email address to lintian-maint@debian.org

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Feb 1998 22:39:46 +0100

lintian (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed manual-pages check: Check for the `undocumented' symbolic
    link failed on X11 manual pages (fixes #18343).

  * Improved files check. New tag:
      etc-cron.d-script-tagged-executable

  * Improved control-files check:
      - the `du' control file is not allowed anymore
      - check file permissions of control files
    New tags:
      control-file-has-bad-permissions

  * Fixed bug: ldd-info collection script stopped when ldd failed

  * Fixed (internal) bugs:
      - collect data for collection scripts too
      - don't collect init.d data every time again

  * Error handling code improved again :)

  * The lintian frontend script checks if it has root permissions and
    aborts if this is the case. (Running it as root is unnecessary and
    simply too dangerous.)

  * Added one override entry

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Feb 1998 21:50:16 +0100

lintian (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug in lintian-setup: don't try to create $LAB if it already
    exists (fixes bug#18227, bug#18252)

  * Added "Depends: file" (oops!)

  * Rewrote package "Description:"

  * Added a lot more override entries (thanks to all that told me about
    overrides!)

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Feb 1998 12:55:58 +0100

lintian (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug in ldconfig collection script: script aborted without
    error message if a shared library had errors (thanks to Kai!)

  * Fixed bug: `standards-version' check didn't collect necessary data
    (actually, this was a more general bug--thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Fixed bug: init.d checker script didn't notice if several of the
    required options (start, stop, etc.) have been included on a single
    line (thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Don't check duplicated packages more than once (thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Error handling code improved once more

  * Added more overrides (Thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Mentioned Lintian's home page in the README file

  * Set package priority to `optional' (requested by several developers)

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Feb 1998 11:44:32 +0100

lintian (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * First public release

  * Fixed bug in shlibs check: Sometimes, ldconfig doesn't install any
    symbolic links at all (e.g., for `acroread' package).

  * Changed lintian-setup: Don't remove the whole lab if it already
    exists--just remove the info/ directory.

  * Changed handling of critical Lintian errors (abort on error)

  * Built package using fakeroot (first time i tried fakeroot--it's great!!)

  * Checked package with latest Lintian :)

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Feb 1998 21:49:10 +0100

lintian (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Next beta release (hopefully the last one :-)

  * The lintian-info script is available now! You can either pipe the output
    of lintian through it, or specify the `-i' option when calling lintian.

  * Lintian can check .changes files now! New tags:
      bad-distribution-in-changes-file
      file-size-mismatch-in-changes-file
      md5sum-mismatch-in-changes-file
      bad-section-in-changes-file

  * Lintian now detects if packages have been changed, even if they
    have the same version number as before.

  * Improved shlibs check (this fixes the "error: bad ldconfig-info file"
    bug). New tags:
      ldconfig-symlink-referencing-wrong-file
      ldconfig-symlink-is-not-a-symlink

  * Improved files check! New tags:
      package-installs-into-etc-rc.d
      non-standard-file-permissions-for-etc-init.d-script

  * New check for /etc/init.d scripts! Tags:
      duplicate-updaterc.d-calls-in-postinst
      output-of-updaterc.d-not-redirected-to-dev-null
      preinst-calls-updaterc.d
      duplicate-updaterc.d-calls-in-postrm
      prerm-calls-updaterc.d
      postrm-does-not-call-updaterc.d-for-init.d-script

      init.d-script-not-included-in-package

    have not been handled correctly.

  * Added new override entries

  * Cleaned up Lintian's source code

  * Updated documentation

  * Lots of small changes
