Subject: [Package] Some sources are not included in your package

Hi,

Your package seems to include some files that lack sources
in prefered forms of modification:

{list of files}

According to Debian Free Software Guidelines [1] (DFSG) ยง2: 
 "The program must include source code, and must allow distribution 
  in source code as well as compiled form.".

This could also constitute a license violation for some copyleft licenses such as the GNU GPL.

In order to solve this problem, you could:
1. repack the origin tarball adding the missing source to it.
2  add the source files to "debian/missing-sources" directory

Both way satisfies the requirement that we ship the source. Second option
might be preferable due to the following reasons [2]:
 - Upstream can do it too and you could even supply a patch to them, thus full filling our social contract [3], see particularly ยง2.
 - If source and non-source are in different locations, ftpmasters may
   miss the source and (needlessly) reject the package.
 - The source isn't duplicated in every .diff.gz/.debian.tar.* (though
   this only really matters for larger sources).

You could also ask debian-qa for more guidance.
